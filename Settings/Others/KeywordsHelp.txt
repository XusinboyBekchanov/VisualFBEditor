Usage
Get #filenum, position, data [, [amount] [, bytesread ] ]
varres = Get (#filenum, position, data [, [amount] [, bytesread ] ] )

Parameters
filenum
The value passed to Open when the file was opened.
position
The position where the read must start. If the file was opened For Random, the position is in records; otherwise, it is in bytes. If omitted, reading starts at the present file pointer position.  The position is 1-based: i.e. first record or byte of a file is at position 1.
If position is omitted or zero (0), file reading will start from the current file position.
data
The buffer where data is written. It can be a numeric variable, a string, an array, a user defined type or a dereferenced pointer. The read operation will try to fill completely the variable, unless the EOF is reached.
When getting arrays, data should be followed by an empty pair of brackets: "()".  Get will read data for all of the values in the array.  amount is not allowed.
When getting Strings, the number of bytes read is the same as the number of bytes in the string data. amount is not allowed.
Note: If you want to read values into a buffer, you should NOT pass a pointer to the buffer; instead you should pass the first variable in the buffer (this can be done by dereferencing the pointer with Operator * (Value Of)). If you pass a pointer directly, then Get will overwrite the pointer variable, not the memory it points to.
amount
Makes Get read amount consecutive variables from file to memory, i.e. it reads (amount * SizeOf(data) ) bytes of data from file into the memory starting at data's memory location.  If amount is omitted it defaults to 1, meaning that Get just reads a single variable.
bytesread
An unsigned integer variable to accept the result of the number of bytes read successfully from the file.

Return Value
Get() returns a 32 bit Long: a zero (0) on success; non-zero on error.
Note: if EOF (end of file) is reached while reading, Get will return success.  The amount of bytes actually read can be checked by passing a bytesread variable.

Description

-------------------------------------------------------- KeyPgPutfileio ----

Put (File I/O)
  

	Writes data from a buffer to a file

Syntax
Put #filenum As Long, [position As LongInt], data As Any [, amount As UInteger]
Put #filenum As Long, [position As LongInt], data As String
Put #filenum As Long, [position As LongInt], data() As Any

Usage
Put #filenum, position, data [, amount]
varres = Put (#filenum, position, data [, amount])

Parameters
filenum
The value passed to Open when the file was opened.
position
Is the position where Put must start in the file. If the file was opened For Random, the position is in records, else it is given in bytes. If omitted, writing starts at the present file pointer position.  The position is 1-based: i.e. the first record or byte of a file is at position 1.
If position is omitted or zero (0), file writing will start from the current file position.
data
Is the buffer where data is written from. It can be a numeric variable, a string, an array or a user-defined type. The operation will try to transfer to disk the complete variable, unless amount is given.
When putting arrays, data should be followed by an empty pair of brackets: '()'.  Put will write all of the data in the array.  amount is not allowed.
When putting Strings, the number of bytes written is the same as the number of bytes in the string data.  amount is not allowed.
Note: If you want to write values from a buffer, you should NOT pass a pointer to the buffer; instead you should pass the first variable in the buffer (this can be done by dereferencing the pointer with Operator * (Value Of)). If you pass a pointer directly, then Put will put the memory from the pointer variable, not the memory it points to.
amount
Makes Put write to file amount consecutive variables to the file - i.e. it writes ( amount * SizeOf(data) ) bytes of data, starting at data's location in memory, into the file.  If amount is omitted it defaults to 1, meaning that Put just writes a single variable.

Return Value
Put() returns a 32 bit Long: 0 on success; nonzero on error. "disk full" is considered as an error, and results in return code 3. An "exact" amount of data written before is not available, and wouldn't be really useful anyway. 

Description
Writes binary data from a buffer variable to a file opened in Binary or Random mode.

Put can be used as a function, and will return 0 on success or an error code on failure.

CryptDestroyKey     [New - Windows NT][New - Windows 95, OEM Service Release 2]The CryptDestroyKey function releases the handle referenced by the hKey parameter. Once a key handle has been released, it becomes invalid and cannot be used again.If the handle refers to a session key, or to a public key that has been imported into the CSP through CryptImportKey, this function destroys the key and frees the memory that the key occupied. Many CSPs will scrub the memory where the key was held before freeing it.On the other hand, if the handle refers to a public/private key pair (obtained from CryptGetUserKey), the underlying key pair is not destroyed by this function. Only the handle is destroyed.
Syntax
Parameters
hKey[in] A handle to the key to be destroyed.
Description
Keys take up memory in both


-------------------------------------------------------- KeyWin32CryptEncrypt ----
CryptEncrypt     [New - Windows NT][New - Windows 95, OEM Service Release 2]The CryptEncrypt function is used to encrypt data. The algorithm used to encrypt the data is designated by the key held by the CSP module, which is referenced by the hKey parameter.BOOL CRYPTFUNC CryptEncrypt(HCRYPTKEY hKey,     HCRYPTHASH hHash,     BOOL Final,     DWORD dwFlags,     BYTE *pbData,     DWORD *pdwDataLen,     DWORD dwBufLen    );
Parameters hKey[in] A handle to the key to use for the encryption. An application obtains this handle by using either the CryptGenKey or the CryptImportKey function.This key specifies the encryption algorithm that is used.hHash[in] A handle to a hash object. This parameter is used only if a hash of the data is to be computed at the same time the encryption is being performed. See the "Remarks" section for more information.If no hash is to be done, this parameter must be zero.Final[in] The Boolean value that specifies whether this is the last section in a series being encrypted. This should be TRUE if this is the last or only block, and FALSE if it is not. See the "Remarks" section for more information.dwFlags[in] The flag values. This parameter is reserved for future use and should always be zero.pbData[in/out] The buffer holding the data to be encrypted. Once the encryption has been performed, the encrypted data is placed back in this same buffer.The size of this buffer is specified by dwBufLen. The number of bytes of data to be encrypted is specified by pdwDataLen.This parameter can be NULL if all you are doing is determining the number of bytes required for the returned data.pdwDataLen[in/out] The address of the data length. Before calling this function, the caller should set this parameter to the number of bytes to be encrypted. Upon return, this address will contain the number of bytes of encrypted data.If the buffer specified by pbData is not large enough to hold the data, the function returns the ERROR_MORE_DATA error code (through GetLastError) and stores the required buffer size, in bytes, into the variable pointed to by pdwDataLen.If pbData is NULL, then no error is returned, and the function stores the size of the data, in bytes, in the variable pointed to be pdwDataLen. This lets an application determine the correct buffer size unambiguously.When a block cipher is used, this data length must be a multiple of the block size, unless this is the final section of data to be encrypted and the Final flag is TRUE.dwBufLen[in] The number of bytes in the pbData buffer.Note that, depending on the algorithm used, the encrypted text can be slightly larger than the original plaintext. In this case, the pbData buffer needs to be sized accordingly.As a rule, if a stream cipher is used the ciphertext will be the same size as the plaintext. If a block cipher is used, the ciphertext will be up to a "block length" larger than the plaintext.
Description
If data is to be hashed and encrypted simultaneously, a handle to a hash object can be passed in the hHash parameter. The hash value will be updated with the plaintext passed in. This option is useful when generating signed and encrypted text.Prior to calling CryptEncrypt, the application should obtain a handle to the hash object by calling the CryptCreateHash function. Once the encryption is complete, the hash value can be obtained through the CryptGetHashParam function or the hash can be signed using the CryptSignHash function.When a large amount of data needs to be encrypted, it can be done in sections. This is done by calling CryptEncrypt repeatedly. The Final parameter should be set to TRUE only on the last invocation of CryptEncrypt, so the encryption engine can properly finish the encryption process. The following extra actions are performed when Final is TRUE:If the key is a block cipher key, the data will be padded to a multiple of the block size of the cipher. To find the block size of a cipher, use CryptGetKeyParam to get the KP_BLOCKLEN parameter of the key.If the cipher is operating in a chaining mode, the next CryptEncrypt operation will reset the cipher's feedback register to the KP_IV value of the key.If the cipher is a stream cipher, the next CryptEncrypt will reset the cipher to its initial state.
Return Values
If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.If the function fails, the return value is zero. To retrieve extended error information, use the GetLastError function.The following table lists the error codes most commonly returned by the GetLastError function. The error codes prefaced by "NTE" are generated by the particular CSP you are using.ErrorDescriptionERROR_INVALID_HANDLEOne of the parameters specifies an invalid handle. ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETEROne of the parameters contains an invalid value. This is most often an illegal pointer.NTE_BAD_ALGIDThe hKey session key specifies an algorithm that this CSP does not support.NTE_BAD_DATAThe data to be encrypted is invalid. For example, when a block cipher is used and the Final flag is FALSE, the value specified by pdwDataLen must be a multiple of the block size.NTE_BAD_FLAGSThe dwFlags parameter is nonzero.NTE_BAD_HASHThe hHash parameter contains an invalid handle.NTE_BAD_KEYThe hKey parameter does not contain a valid handle to a key.NTE_BAD_LENThe size of the output buffer is too small to hold the generated ciphertext.NTE_BAD_UIDThe CSP context that was specified when the key was created cannot be found.NTE_DOUBLE_ENCRYPTThe application attempted to encrypt the same data twice.NTE_FAILThe function failed in some unexpected way.NTE_NO_MEMORYThe CSP ran out of memory during the operation.

-------------------------------------------------------- KeyWin32Yield ----
Yield   The Yield function is obsolete. This function is provided only for compatibility with 16-bit versions of Windows. In the Win32-based application programming interface (API), this function does nothing. Threads that contain windows should use the DispatchMessage, PeekMessage, or TranslateMessage functions. The message-loop functions handle message synchronization properly and yield at the appropriate times. Threads that do not contain windows should use the Sleep function with a sleep time of zero milliseconds to give up the remainder of their current time slice.Threads that create a process can use WaitForInputIdle to wait until the new process has finished its initialization.
