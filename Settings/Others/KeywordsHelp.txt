Get #filenum As Long, [position As LongInt], data As String [, , ByRef bytesread As UInteger ]
Get #filenum As Long, [position As LongInt], data() As Any [, , ByRef bytesread As UInteger ]

Usage
Get #filenum, position, data [, [amount] [, bytesread ] ]
varres = Get (#filenum, position, data [, [amount] [, bytesread ] ] )

Parameters
filenum
The value passed to Open when the file was opened.
position
The position where the read must start. If the file was opened For Random, the position is in records; otherwise, it is in bytes. If omitted, reading starts at the present file pointer position.  The position is 1-based: i.e. first record or byte of a file is at position 1.
If position is omitted or zero (0), file reading will start from the current file position.
data
The buffer where data is written. It can be a numeric variable, a string, an array, a user defined type or a dereferenced pointer. The read operation will try to fill completely the variable, unless the EOF is reached.
When getting arrays, data should be followed by an empty pair of brackets: "()".  Get will read data for all of the values in the array.  amount is not allowed.
When getting Strings, the number of bytes read is the same as the number of bytes in the string data. amount is not allowed.
Note: If you want to read values into a buffer, you should NOT pass a pointer to the buffer; instead you should pass the first variable in the buffer (this can be done by dereferencing the pointer with Operator * (Value Of)). If you pass a pointer directly, then Get will overwrite the pointer variable, not the memory it points to.
amount
Makes Get read amount consecutive variables from file to memory, i.e. it reads (amount * SizeOf(data) ) bytes of data from file into the memory starting at data's memory location.  If amount is omitted it defaults to 1, meaning that Get just reads a single variable.
bytesread
An unsigned integer variable to accept the result of the number of bytes read successfully from the file.

Return Value
Get() returns a 32 bit Long: a zero (0) on success; non-zero on error.
Note: if EOF (end of file) is reached while reading, Get will return success.  The amount of bytes actually read can be checked by passing a bytesread variable.

Description
Reads binary data from a file to a buffer variable

Get can be used as a function, and will return 0 on success or an error code on failure.

------------ KeyPgPutfileio ----

Put (File I/O)
  

	Writes data from a buffer to a file

Syntax
Put #filenum As Long, [position As LongInt], data As Any [, amount As UInteger]
Put #filenum As Long, [position As LongInt], data As String
Put #filenum As Long, [position As LongInt], data() As Any

Usage
Put #filenum, position, data [, amount]
varres = Put (#filenum, position, data [, amount])

Parameters
filenum
The value passed to Open when the file was opened.
position
Is the position where Put must start in the file. If the file was opened For Random, the position is in records, else it is given in bytes. If omitted, writing starts at the present file pointer position.  The position is 1-based: i.e. the first record or byte of a file is at position 1.
If position is omitted or zero (0), file writing will start from the current file position.
data
Is the buffer where data is written from. It can be a numeric variable, a string, an array or a user-defined type. The operation will try to transfer to disk the complete variable, unless amount is given.
When putting arrays, data should be followed by an empty pair of brackets: '()'.  Put will write all of the data in the array.  amount is not allowed.
When putting Strings, the number of bytes written is the same as the number of bytes in the string data.  amount is not allowed.
Note: If you want to write values from a buffer, you should NOT pass a pointer to the buffer; instead you should pass the first variable in the buffer (this can be done by dereferencing the pointer with Operator * (Value Of)). If you pass a pointer directly, then Put will put the memory from the pointer variable, not the memory it points to.
amount
Makes Put write to file amount consecutive variables to the file - i.e. it writes ( amount * SizeOf(data) ) bytes of data, starting at data's location in memory, into the file.  If amount is omitted it defaults to 1, meaning that Put just writes a single variable.

Return Value
Put() returns a 32 bit Long: 0 on success; nonzero on error. "disk full" is considered as an error, and results in return code 3. An "exact" amount of data written before is not available, and wouldn't be really useful anyway. 

Description
Writes binary data from a buffer variable to a file opened in Binary or Random mode.

Put can be used as a function, and will return 0 on success or an error code on failure.

This function guarantees that all keys generated from the same base data will be identical, provided the same CSP and algorithms are used. The base data can be a password or any other user data.This function is the same as CryptGenKey, except that the generated session keys are derived from base data instead of being random. Another difference is that the CryptDeriveKey function cannot be used to generate public/private key pairs.A handle to the session key is returned in phKey. This handle can then be used as needed with any of the other CryptoAPI functions that require key handles.
Syntax

------------ KeyWin32CryptDestroyKey ----
CryptDestroyKey     [New - Windows NT][New - Windows 95, OEM Service Release 2]The CryptDestroyKey function releases the handle referenced by the hKey parameter. Once a key handle has been released, it becomes invalid and cannot be used again.If the handle refers to a session key, or to a public key that has been imported into the CSP through CryptImportKey, this function destroys the key and frees the memory that the key occupied. Many CSPs will scrub the memory where the key was held before freeing it.On the other hand, if the handle refers to a public/private key pair (obtained from CryptGetUserKey), the underlying key pair is not destroyed by this function. Only the handle is destroyed.
Syntax
Parameters
hKey[in] A handle to the key to be destroyed.
Description
Keys take up memory in both


------------ KeyWin32CryptEncrypt ----
CryptEncrypt     [New - Windows NT][New - Windows 95, OEM Service Release 2]The CryptEncrypt function is used to encrypt data. The algorithm used to encrypt the data is designated by the key held by the CSP module, which is referenced by the hKey parameter.BOOL CRYPTFUNC CryptEncrypt(HCRYPTKEY hKey,     HCRYPTHASH hHash,     BOOL Final,     DWORD dwFlags,     BYTE *pbData,     DWORD *pdwDataLen,     DWORD dwBufLen    );
Parameters hKey[in] A handle to the key to use for the encryption. An application obtains this handle by using either the CryptGenKey or the CryptImportKey function.This key specifies the encryption algorithm that is used.hHash[in] A handle to a hash object. This parameter is used only if a hash of the data is to be computed at the same time the encryption is being performed. See the "Remarks" section for more information.If no hash is to be done, this parameter must be zero.Final[in] The Boolean value that specifies whether this is the last section in a series being encrypted. This should be TRUE if this is the last or only block, and FALSE if it is not. See the "Remarks" section for more information.dwFlags[in] The flag values. This parameter is reserved for future use and should always be zero.pbData[in/out] The buffer holding the data to be encrypted. Once the encryption has been performed, the encrypted data is placed back in this same buffer.The size of this buffer is specified by dwBufLen. The number of bytes of data to be encrypted is specified by pdwDataLen.This parameter can be NULL if all you are doing is determining the number of bytes required for the returned data.pdwDataLen[in/out] The address of the data length. Before calling this function, the caller should set this parameter to the number of bytes to be encrypted. Upon return, this address will contain the number of bytes of encrypted data.If the buffer specified by pbData is not large enough to hold the data, the function returns the ERROR_MORE_DATA error code (through GetLastError) and stores the required buffer size, in bytes, into the variable pointed to by pdwDataLen.If pbData is NULL, then no error is returned, and the function stores the size of the data, in bytes, in the variable pointed to be pdwDataLen. This lets an application determine the correct buffer size unambiguously.When a block cipher is used, this data length must be a multiple of the block size, unless this is the final section of data to be encrypted and the Final flag is TRUE.dwBufLen[in] The number of bytes in the pbData buffer.Note that, depending on the algorithm used, the encrypted text can be slightly larger than the original plaintext. In this case, the pbData buffer needs to be sized accordingly.As a rule, if a stream cipher is used the ciphertext will be the same size as the plaintext. If a block cipher is used, the ciphertext will be up to a "block length" larger than the plaintext.
Description
If data is to be hashed and encrypted simultaneously, a handle to a hash object can be passed in the hHash parameter. The hash value will be updated with the plaintext passed in. This option is useful when generating signed and encrypted text.Prior to calling CryptEncrypt, the application should obtain a handle to the hash object by calling the CryptCreateHash function. Once the encryption is complete, the hash value can be obtained through the CryptGetHashParam function or the hash can be signed using the CryptSignHash function.When a large amount of data needs to be encrypted, it can be done in sections. This is done by calling CryptEncrypt repeatedly. The Final parameter should be set to TRUE only on the last invocation of CryptEncrypt, so the encryption engine can properly finish the encryption process. The following extra actions are performed when Final is TRUE:If the key is a block cipher key, the data will be padded to a multiple of the block size of the cipher. To find the block size of a cipher, use CryptGetKeyParam to get the KP_BLOCKLEN parameter of the key.If the cipher is operating in a chaining mode, the next CryptEncrypt operation will reset the cipher's feedback register to the KP_IV value of the key.If the cipher is a stream cipher, the next CryptEncrypt will reset the cipher to its initial state.
Return Values
If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero.If the function fails, the return value is zero. To retrieve extended error information, use the GetLastError function.The following table lists the error codes most commonly returned by the GetLastError function. The error codes prefaced by "NTE" are generated by the particular CSP you are using.ErrorDescriptionERROR_INVALID_HANDLEOne of the parameters specifies an invalid handle. ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETEROne of the parameters contains an invalid value. This is most often an illegal pointer.NTE_BAD_ALGIDThe hKey session key specifies an algorithm that this CSP does not support.NTE_BAD_DATAThe data to be encrypted is invalid. For example, when a block cipher is used and the Final flag is FALSE, the value specified by pdwDataLen must be a multiple of the block size.NTE_BAD_FLAGSThe dwFlags parameter is nonzero.NTE_BAD_HASHThe hHash parameter contains an invalid handle.NTE_BAD_KEYThe hKey parameter does not contain a valid handle to a key.NTE_BAD_LENThe size of the output buffer is too small to hold the generated ciphertext.NTE_BAD_UIDThe CSP context that was specified when the key was created cannot be found.NTE_DOUBLE_ENCRYPTThe application attempted to encrypt the same data twice.NTE_FAILThe function failed in some unexpected way.NTE_NO_MEMORYThe CSP ran out of memory during the operation.

Cut/copy/paste menu itemsconceptually copy the contents of the GDK_SELECTION_PRIMARY clipboardto the default clipboard, i.e. they copy the selection to what theuser sees as the clipboard.(Passing GDK_NONE is the same as using gdk_atom_intern("CLIPBOARD", FALSE).See theFreeDesktop Clipboard Specificationfor a detailed discussion of the ?CLIPBOARD? vs. ?PRIMARY?selections under the X window system. On Win32 theGDK_SELECTION_PRIMARY clipboard is essentially ignored.)It?s possible to have arbitrary named clipboards; if you do inventnew clipboards, you should prefix the selection name with anunderscore (because the ICCCM requires that nonstandard atoms areunderscore-prefixed), and namespace it as well. For example,if your application called ?Foo? has a special-purposeclipboard, you might call it ?_FOO_SPECIAL_CLIPBOARD?.
Syntax
Parameters
display    	the GdkDisplay for which the clipboard is to be retrieved or created.
selection    	a GdkAtom which identifies the clipboard to use.

event    	The event that triggered the start of the drag.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_drag_begin_with_coordinates ----
gtk_drag_begin_with_coordinates 
Initiates a drag on the source side. The function only needs to be usedwhen the application is starting drags itself, and is not needed whengtk_drag_source_set  is used.The event is used to retrieve the timestamp that will be used internally tograb the pointer.  If event is NULL, then GDK_CURRENT_TIME will be used.However, you should try to pass a real event in all cases, since that can beused to get information about the drag.Generally there are three cases when you want to start a drag by hand bycalling this function:During a ?button-press-event? handler, if you want to start a dragimmediately when the user presses the mouse button.  Pass the eventthat you have in your ?button-press-event? handler.During a ?motion-notify-event? handler, if you want to start a dragwhen the mouse moves past a certain threshold distance after a button-press.Pass the event that you have in your ?motion-notify-event? handler.During a timeout handler, if you want to start a drag after the mousebutton is held down for some time.  Try to save the last event that you gotfrom the mouse, using gdk_event_copy , and pass it to this function(remember to free the event with gdk_event_free  when you are done).If you can really not pass a real event, pass NULL instead.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	the source widget.

actions    	A bitmask of the allowed drag actions for this drag.
button    	The button the user clicked to start the drag.
event    	The event that triggered the start of the drag.
x    	The initial x coordinate to start dragging from, in the coordinate spaceof widget. If -1 is passed, the coordinates are retrieved from eventorthe current pointer position.
y    	The initial y coordinate to start dragging from, in the coordinate spaceof widget. If -1 is passed, the coordinates are retrieved from eventorthe current pointer position.

Checks that the GTK+ library in use is compatible with thegiven version. Generally you would pass in the constantsGTK_MAJOR_VERSION, GTK_MINOR_VERSION, GTK_MICRO_VERSIONas the three arguments to this function; that producesa check that the library in use is compatible withthe version of GTK+ the application or module was compiledagainst.Compatibility is defined by two things: first the versionof the running library is newer than the versionrequired_major.required_minor.required_micro. Secondthe running library must be binary compatible with theversion required_major.required_minor.required_micro(same major version.)This function is primarily for GTK+ modules; the modulecan call this function to check that it wasn?t loadedinto an incompatible version of GTK+. However, such acheck isn?t completely reliable, since the module may belinked against an old version of GTK+ and calling theold version of gtk_check_version , but still get loadedinto an application using a newer version of GTK+.
Syntax

GTK_TEXT_DIR_NONE will never be returned.GTK+ sets the default text direction according to the localeduring gtk_init , and you should normally usegtk_widget_get_direction  or gtk_widget_get_default_direction to obtain the current direcion.This function is only needed rare cases when the locale ischanged after GTK+ has already been initialized. In this case,you can use it to update the default text direction as follows:                    123[/syntax]        [syntax]setlocale (LC_ALL, new_locale);direction = gtk_get_locale_direction  ;gtk_widget_set_default_direction (direction);[/syntax]      
      
Returns
 the GtkTextDirection of the current locale

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_parse_args ----
gtk_parse_args 
Parses command line arguments, and initializes globalattributes of GTK+, but does not actually open a connectionto a display. (See gdk_display_open , gdk_get_display_arg_name )Any arguments used by GTK+ or GDK are removed from the array andargc and argv are updated accordingly.There is no need to call this function explicitly if you are usinggtk_init , or gtk_init_check .
Syntax
Parameters
argc    	 a pointer to the number of command line arguments. [inout]
argv    	 a pointer to the array ofcommand line arguments. [array length=argc][inout]
Returns
 TRUE if initialization succeeded, otherwise FALSE

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_init ----
gtk_init 
Call this function before using any other GTK+ functions in your GUIapplications.  It will initialize everything needed to operate thetoolkit and parses some standard command line options.Although you are expected to pass the argc, argv parameters from main  to this function, it is possible to pass NULL if argv is not available or commandline handling is not required.argc and argv are adjusted accordingly so your own code willnever see those standard arguments.Note that there are some alternative ways to initialize GTK+:if you are calling gtk_parse_args , gtk_init_check ,gtk_init_with_args  or g_option_context_parse  withthe option group returned by gtk_get_option_group ,you don?t have to call gtk_init .This function will terminate your program if it was unable toinitialize the windowing system for some reason. If you wantyour program to fall back to a textual interface you want tocall gtk_init_check  instead.
Since 2.18, GTK+ calls signal (SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)during initialization, to ignore SIGPIPE signals, since these arealmost never wanted in graphical applications. If you do need tohandle SIGPIPE for some reason, reset the handler after gtk_init ,but notice that other libraries (e.g. libdbus or gvfs) might dosimilar things.
Syntax
Parameters
argc    	 Address of the argc parameter ofyour main  function (or 0 if argvis NULL). This will be changed ifany arguments were handled. [inout]
argv    	 Address of theargv parameter of main , or NULL. Any optionsunderstood by GTK+ are stripped before return. [array length=argc][inout][allow-none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_init_check ----
gtk_init_check 
This function does the same work as gtk_init  with only a singlechange: It does not terminate the program if the windowing systemcan?t be initialized. Instead it returns FALSE on failure.This way the application can fall back to some other means ofcommunication with the user - for example a curses or command lineinterface.
Syntax
Parameters
argc    	 Address of the argc parameter ofyour main  function (or 0 if argvis NULL). This will be changed ifany arguments were handled. [inout]
argv    	 Address of theargv parameter of main , or NULL. Any optionsunderstood by GTK+ are stripped before return. [array length=argc][inout][allow-none]
Returns
 TRUE if the windowing system has been successfullyinitialized, FALSE otherwise

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_init_with_args ----
gtk_init_with_args 
This function does the same work as gtk_init_check .Additionally, it allows you to add your own commandline options,and it automatically generates nicely formatted--help output. Note that your program willbe terminated after writing out the help output.
Syntax
Parameters
argc    	 Address of the argc parameter ofyour main  function (or 0 if argvis NULL). This will be changed ifany arguments were handled. [inout]
argv    	 Address of theargv parameter of main , or NULL. Any optionsunderstood by GTK+ are stripped before return. [array length=argc][inout][allow-none]
parameter_string    	 a string which is displayed inthe first line of --help output, afterprogramname [OPTION...]. [allow-none]
entries    	 a NULL-terminated arrayof GOptionEntrys describing the options of your program. [array zero-terminated=1]
translation_domain    	a translation domain to use for translatingthe --help output for the options in entriesand the parameter_stringwith gettext , or NULL
error    	a return location for errors
Returns
 TRUE if the windowing system has been successfullyinitialized, FALSE otherwise

Makes the innermost invocation of the main loop returnwhen it regains control.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_main_iteration ----
gtk_main_iteration 
Runs a single iteration of the mainloop.If no events are waiting to be processed GTK+ will blockuntil the next event is noticed. If you don?t want to blocklook at gtk_main_iteration_do  or check if any events arepending with gtk_events_pending  first.

 TRUE if gtk_main_quit  has been called for theinnermost mainloop

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_main_iteration_do ----
gtk_main_iteration_do

Returns
 TRUE if gtk_main_quit  has been called for theinnermost mainloop

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_main_do_event ----
gtk_main_do_event 
Processes a single GDK event.This is public only to allow filtering of events between GDK and GTK+.You will not usually need to call this function directly.While you should not call this function directly, you might want toknow how exactly events are handled. So here is what this functiondoes with the event:Compress enter/leave notify events. If the event passed build anenter/leave pair together with the next event (peeked from GDK), bothevents are thrown away. This is to avoid a backlog of (de-)highlightingwidgets crossed by the pointer.Find the widget which got the event. If the widget can?t be determinedthe event is thrown away unless it belongs to a INCR transaction.Then the event is pushed onto a stack so you can query the currentlyhandled event with gtk_get_current_event .The event is sent to a widget. If a grab is active all events for widgetsthat are not in the contained in the grab widget are sent to the latterwith a few exceptions:Deletion and destruction events are still sent to the event widget forobvious reasons.Events which directly relate to the visual representation of the eventwidget.Leave events are delivered to the event widget if there was an enterevent delivered to it before without the paired leave event.Drag events are not redirected because it is unclear what the semanticsof that would be.Another point of interest might be that all key events are first passedthrough the key snooper functions if there are any. Read the descriptionof gtk_key_snooper_install  if you need this feature.After finishing the delivery the event is popped from the event stack.
Syntax
Parameters
event    	An event to process (normally passed by GDK)

Sends an event to a widget, propagating the event to parent widgetsif the event remains unhandled.Events received by GTK+ from GDK normally begin in gtk_main_do_event .Depending on the type of event, existence of modal dialogs, grabs, etc.,the event may be propagated; if so, this function is used.gtk_propagate_event  calls gtk_widget_event  on each widget itdecides to send the event to. So gtk_widget_event  is the lowest-levelfunction; it simply emits the ?event? and possibly anevent-specific signal on a widget. gtk_propagate_event  is a bithigher-level, and gtk_main_do_event  is the highest level.All that said, you most likely don?t want to use any of thesefunctions; synthesizing events is rarely needed. There are almostcertainly better ways to achieve your goals. For example, usegdk_window_invalidate_rect  or gtk_widget_queue_draw  insteadof making up expose events.

Syntax
Parameters
op    	a GtkPrintOperation
track_status    	TRUE to track status after printing

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_print_operation_run ----
gtk_print_operation_run 
Runs the print operation, by first letting the user modifyprint settings in the print dialog, and then print the document.Normally that this function does not return until the rendering of all pages is complete. You can connect to the ?status-changed? signal on op to obtain some information about the progress of the print operation. Furthermore, it may use a recursive mainloop to show the print dialog.If you call gtk_print_operation_set_allow_async  or set the ?allow-async? property the operation will run asynchronously if this is supported on the platform. The ?done? signal will be emitted with the result of the operation when the it is done (i.e. when the dialog is canceled, or when the print succeeds or fails).                    1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435[/syntax]        [syntax]if (settings != NULL)  gtk_print_operation_set_print_settings (print, settings);  if (page_setup != NULL)  gtk_print_operation_set_default_page_setup (print, page_setup);  g_signal_connect (print, "begin-print",                   G_CALLBACK (begin_print), &data);g_signal_connect (print, "draw-page",                   G_CALLBACK (draw_page), &data); res = gtk_print_operation_run (print,                                GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_ACTION_PRINT_DIALOG,                                parent,                                &error); if (res == GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_RESULT_ERROR) {   error_dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (GTK_WINDOW (parent),                                 GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT,                         GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,                         GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,                         "Error printing file:\n%s",                         error->message);   g_signal_connect (error_dialog, "response",                      G_CALLBACK (gtk_widget_destroy), NULL);   gtk_widget_show (error_dialog);   g_error_free (error); }else if (res == GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_RESULT_APPLY) {   if (settings != NULL)g_object_unref (settings);   settings = g_object_ref (gtk_print_operation_get_print_settings (print)); }[/syntax]

Normally applications create aGtkIconFactory, then add it to the list of default factories withgtk_icon_factory_add_default . Then they pass the stock_id towidgets such as GtkImage to display the icon. Themes can providean icon with the same name (such as "myapp-whatever-icon") tooverride your application?s default icons. If an icon alreadyexisted in factory for stock_id, it is unreferenced and replacedwith the new icon_set.
Syntax
Parameters

The default icon factoriescan be overridden by themes.
Syntax
Parameters
factory    	a GtkIconFactory

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_icon_factory_lookup ----
gtk_icon_factory_lookup 
gtk_icon_factory_lookup has been deprecated since version 3.10 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use GtkIconTheme instead.Looks up stock_id in the icon factory, returning an icon setif found, otherwise NULL. For display to the user, you shoulduse gtk_style_lookup_icon_set  on the GtkStyle for thewidget that will display the icon, instead of using thisfunction directly, so that themes are taken into account.

factory    	a GtkIconFactory
stock_id    	an icon name
Returns
 icon set of stock_id. [transfer none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_icon_factory_lookup_default ----

Fordisplay to the user, you should use gtk_style_lookup_icon_set  onthe GtkStyle for the widget that will display the icon, instead ofusing this function directly, so that themes are taken intoaccount.
Syntax
Parameters
stock_id    	an icon name
Returns
 a GtkIconSet, or NULL. [transfer none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_icon_factory_new ----
gtk_icon_factory_new 
gtk_icon_factory_new has been deprecated since version 3.10 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use GtkIconTheme instead.Creates a new GtkIconFactory. An icon factory manages a collectionof GtkIconSets; a GtkIconSet manages a set of variants of aparticular icon (i.e. a GtkIconSet contains variants for differentsizes and widget states). Icons in an icon factory are named by astock ID, which is a simple string identifying the icon. EachGtkStyle has a list of GtkIconFactorys derived from the currenttheme; those icon factories are consulted first when searching foran icon. If the theme doesn?t set a particular icon, GTK+ looks forthe icon in a list of default icon factories, maintained bygtk_icon_factory_add_default  andgtk_icon_factory_remove_default . Applications with icons shouldadd a default icon factory with their icons, which will allowthemes to override the icons for the application.
Returns
 a new GtkIconFactory

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_icon_factory_remove_default ----
gtk_icon_factory_remove_default 
gtk_icon_factory_remove_default has been deprecated since version 3.10 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use GtkIconTheme instead.Removes an icon factory from the list of default iconfactories. Not normally used; you might use it for a library thatcan be unloaded or shut down.

Parameters
factory    	a GtkIconFactory previously added with gtk_icon_factory_add_default 

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_icon_set_add_source ----
gtk_icon_set_add_source 
gtk_icon_set_add_source has been deprecated since version 3.10 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use GtkIconTheme instead.Icon sets have a list of GtkIconSource, which they use as baseicons for rendering icons in different states and sizes. Icons arescaled, made to look insensitive, etc. ingtk_icon_set_render_icon , but GtkIconSet needs base images towork with. The base images and when to use them are described bya GtkIconSource.This function copies source, so you can reuse the same source immediatelywithout affecting the icon set.An example of when you?d use this function: a web browser?s "Backto Previous Page" icon might point in a different direction inHebrew and in English; it might look different when insensitive;and it might change size depending on toolbar mode (small/largeicons). So a single icon set would contain all those variants ofthe icon, and you might add a separate source for each one.You should nearly always add a ?default? icon source with allfields wildcarded, which will be used as a fallback if no morespecific source matches. GtkIconSet always prefers more specificicon sources to more generic icon sources. The order in which youadd the sources to the icon set does not matter.gtk_icon_set_new_from_pixbuf  creates a new icon set with adefault icon source based on the given pixbuf.

A GtkIconSet represents a single iconin various sizes and widget states. It can provide a GdkPixbuffor a given size and state on request, and automatically cachessome of the rendered GdkPixbuf objects.Normally you would use gtk_widget_render_icon_pixbuf  instead ofusing GtkIconSet directly. The one case where you?d useGtkIconSet is to create application-specific icon sets to place ina GtkIconFactory.
Returns
 a new GtkIconSet

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_icon_set_new_from_pixbuf ----
gtk_icon_set_new_from_pixbuf 
gtk_icon_set_new_from_pixbuf has been deprecated since version 3.10 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use GtkIconTheme instead.Creates a new GtkIconSet with pixbuf as the default/fallbacksource image.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_icon_source_new ----
gtk_icon_source_new 
gtk_icon_source_new has been deprecated since version 3.10 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use GtkIconTheme instead.Creates a new GtkIconSource. A GtkIconSource contains a GdkPixbuf (orimage filename) that serves as the base image for one or more of theicons in a GtkIconSet, along with a specification for which icons in theicon set will be based on that pixbuf or image file. An icon set containsa set of icons that represent ?the same? logical concept in different states,different global text directions, and different sizes.So for example a web browser?s ?Back to Previous Page? icon mightpoint in a different direction in Hebrew and in English; it mightlook different when insensitive; and it might change size dependingon toolbar mode (small/large icons). So a single icon set wouldcontain all those variants of the icon. GtkIconSet contains a listof GtkIconSource from which it can derive specific icon variants inthe set.In the simplest case, GtkIconSet contains one source pixbuf fromwhich it derives all variants. The convenience functiongtk_icon_set_new_from_pixbuf  handles this case; if you only haveone source pixbuf, just use that function.If you want to use a different base pixbuf for different iconvariants, you create multiple icon sources, mark which variantsthey?ll be used to create, and add them to the icon set withgtk_icon_set_add_source .By default, the icon source has all parameters wildcarded. That is,the icon source will be used as the base icon for any desired textdirection, widget state, or icon size.
Returns
 a new GtkIconSource

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_actionable_set_action_target_value ----
gtk_actionable_set_action_target_value 
Sets the target value of an actionable widget.If target_value is NULL then the target value is unset.The target value has two purposes.  First, it is used as theparameter to activation of the action associated with theGtkActionable widget. Second, it is used to determine if the widgetshould be rendered as ?active? - the widget is active if the stateis equal to the given target.Consider the example of associating a set of buttons with a GActionwith string state in a typical ?radio button? situation.  Each buttonwill be associated with the same action, but with a different targetvalue for that action.  Clicking on a particular button will activatethe action with the target of that button, which will typically causethe action?s state to change to that value.  Since the action?s stateis now equal to the target value of the button, the button will nowbe rendered as active (and the other buttons, with different targets,rendered inactive).

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_application_new ----
gtk_application_new 
Creates a new GtkApplication instance.When using GtkApplication, it is not necessary to call gtk_init manually. It is called as soon as the application gets registered asthe primary instance.Concretely, gtk_init  is called in the default handler for the?startup? signal. Therefore, GtkApplication subclasses shouldchain up in their ?startup? handler before using any GTK+ API.Note that commandline arguments are not passed to gtk_init .All GTK+ functionality that is available via commandline argumentscan also be achieved by setting suitable environment variablessuch as G_DEBUG, so this should not be a bigproblem. If you absolutely must support GTK+ commandline arguments,you can explicitly call gtk_init  before creating the applicationinstance.If non-NULL, the application ID must be valid.  Seeg_application_id_is_valid .If no application ID is given then some features (most notably application uniqueness) will be disabled. A null application ID is only allowed with GTK+ 3.6 or later.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_application_inhibit ----
gtk_application_inhibit 
Inform the session manager that certain types of actions should beinhibited. This is not guaranteed to work on all platforms and forall types of actions.Applications should invoke this method when they begin an operationthat should not be interrupted, such as creating a CD or DVD. Thetypes of actions that may be blocked are specified by the flagsparameter. When the application completes the operation it shouldcall gtk_application_uninhibit  to remove the inhibitor. Note thatan application can have multiple inhibitors, and all of the mustbe individually removed. Inhibitors are also cleared when theapplication exits.Applications should not expect that they will always be able to blockthe action. In most cases, users will be given the option to forcethe action to take place.Reasons should be short and to the point.If window is given, the session manager may point the user tothis window to find out more about why the action is inhibited.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_builder_connect_signals ----
gtk_builder_connect_signals 
This method is a simpler variation of gtk_builder_connect_signals_full .It uses symbols explicitly added to builder with prior calls togtk_builder_add_callback_symbol . In the case that symbols are notexplicitly added; it uses GModule?s introspective features (by opening the module NULL) to look at the application?s symbol table. From here it tries to matchthe signal handler names given in the interface description withsymbols in the application and connects the signals. Note that thisfunction can only be called once, subsequent calls will do nothing.Note that unless gtk_builder_add_callback_symbol  is called forall signal callbacks which are referenced by the loaded XML, this function will require that GModule be supported on the platform.If you rely on GModule support to lookup callbacks in the symbol table,the following details should be noted:When compiling applications for Windows, you must declare signal callbackswith G_MODULE_EXPORT, or they will not be put in the symbol table.On Linux and Unices, this is not necessary; applications should insteadbe compiled with the -Wl,--export-dynamic CFLAGS, and linked againstgmodule-export-2.0.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_container_add ----
gtk_container_add 
Adds widget to container. Typically used for simple containerssuch as GtkWindow, GtkFrame, or GtkButton; for more complicatedlayout containers such as GtkBox or GtkGrid, this function willpick default packing parameters that may not be correct.  Soconsider functions such as gtk_box_pack_start  andgtk_grid_attach  as an alternative to gtk_container_add  inthose cases. A widget may be added to only one container at a time;you can?t place the same widget inside two different containers.Note that some containers, such as GtkScrolledWindow or GtkListBox,may add intermediate children between the added widget and thecontainer.
Syntax
Parameters
container    	a GtkContainer
widget    	a widget to be placed inside container

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_container_remove ----
gtk_container_remove 
Removes widget from container. widget must be inside container.Note that container will own a reference to widget, and that thismay be the last reference held; so removing a widget from itscontainer can destroy that widget. If you want to use widgetagain, you need to add a reference to it while it?s not insidea container, using g_object_ref . If you don?t want to use widgetagain it?s usually more efficient to simply destroy it directlyusing gtk_widget_destroy  since this will remove it from thecontainer and help break any circular reference count cycles.

Retrieves the border width of the container. Seegtk_container_set_border_width .
Syntax
Parameters
container    	a GtkContainer
Returns
 the current border width

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_container_set_border_width ----
gtk_container_set_border_width 
Sets the border width of the container.The border width of a container is the amount of space to leavearound the outside of the container. The only exception to this isGtkWindow; because toplevel windows can?t leave space outside,they leave the space inside. The border is added on all sides ofthe container. To add space to only one side, one approach is tocreate a GtkAlignment widget, call gtk_widget_set_size_request to give it a size, and place it on the side of the container asa spacer.
Syntax
Parameters

border_width    	amount of blank space to leave outsidethe container. Valid values are in the range 0-65535 pixels.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_container_propagate_draw ----
gtk_container_propagate_draw 
When a container receives a call to the draw function, it must sendsynthetic ?draw? calls to all children that don?t have theirown GdkWindows. This function provides a convenient way of doing this.A container, when it receives a call to its ?draw? function,calls gtk_container_propagate_draw  once for each child, passing inthe cr the container received.gtk_container_propagate_draw  takes care of translating the origin of cr,and deciding whether the draw needs to be sent to the child. It is aconvenient and optimized way of getting the same effect as callinggtk_widget_draw  on the child directly.In most cases, a container can simply either inherit the?draw? implementation from GtkContainer, or do some drawingand then chain to the ::draw implementation from GtkContainer.
Syntax
Parameters
container    	a GtkContainer
child    	a child of container
cr    	Cairo context as passed to the container. If you want to use crin container?s draw function, consider using cairo_save  andcairo_restore  before calling this function.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_container_get_focus_chain ----
gtk_container_get_focus_chain 
Retrieves the focus chain of the container, if one has beenset explicitly. If no focus chain has been explicitlyset, GTK+ computes the focus chain based on the positionsof the children. In that case, GTK+ stores NULL infocusable_widgets and returns FALSE.
Syntax
Parameters
container    	a GtkContainer
focusable_widgets    	 locationto store the focus chain of thecontainer, or NULL. You should free this listusing g_list_free  when you are done with it, howeverno additional reference count is added to theindividual widgets in the focus chain. [element-type GtkWidget][out][transfer container]
Returns
 TRUE if the focus chain of the containerhas been set explicitly.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_container_set_focus_chain ----
gtk_container_set_focus_chain 
Sets a focus chain, overriding the one computed automatically by GTK+.In principle each widget in the chain should be a descendant of thecontainer, but this is not enforced by this method, since it?s allowedto set the focus chain before you pack the widgets, or have a widgetin the chain that isn?t always packed. The necessary checks are donewhen the focus chain is actually traversed.
Syntax
Parameters
container    	a GtkContainer
focusable_widgets    	    the new focus chain. [transfer none][element-type GtkWidget]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_container_unset_focus_chain ----

This allows thesubclass to ignore the border width in its size request andallocate methods. The intent is for a subclass to invoke thisin its class_init function.gtk_container_class_handle_border_width  is necessary because itwould break API too badly to make this behavior the default. Sosubclasses must ?opt in? to the parent class handling border_widthfor them.

Creates a new dialog box.Widgets should not be packed into this GtkWindowdirectly, but into the vbox and action_area, as described above.
Returns
 the new dialog as a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons ----
gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons 
Creates a new GtkDialog with title title (or NULL for the defaulttitle; see gtk_window_set_title ) and transient parent parent (orNULL for none; see gtk_window_set_transient_for ). The flagsargument can be used to make the dialog modal (GTK_DIALOG_MODAL)and/or to have it destroyed along with its transient parent(GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT). After flags, buttontext/response ID pairs should be listed, with a NULL pointer endingthe list. Button text can be arbitrary text. A response ID can beany positive number, or one of the values in the GtkResponseTypeenumeration. If the user clicks one of these dialog buttons,GtkDialog will emit the ?response? signal with the correspondingresponse ID. If a GtkDialog receives the ?delete-event? signal,it will emit ::response with a response ID of GTK_RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT.However, destroying a dialog does not emit the ::response signal;so be careful relying on ::response when using theGTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT flag. Buttons are from left to right,so the first button in the list will be the leftmost button in the dialog.Here?s a simple example:                    12345678910[/syntax]        [syntax]GtkWidget *dialog;GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_MODAL | GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;dialog = gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons ("My dialog",                                      main_app_window,                                      flags,                                      _("_OK"),                                      GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,                                      _("_Cancel"),                                      GTK_RESPONSE_REJECT,                                      NULL);[/syntax]      
      
Syntax
Parameters
title    	 Title of the dialog, or NULL. [allow-none]
parent    	 Transient parent of the dialog, or NULL. [allow-none]
flags    	from GtkDialogFlags

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_dialog_run ----
gtk_dialog_run 
Blocks in a recursive main loop until the dialog either emits the?response? signal, or is destroyed. If the dialog isdestroyed during the call to gtk_dialog_run , gtk_dialog_run  returnsGTK_RESPONSE_NONE. Otherwise, it returns the response ID from the::response signal emission.Before entering the recursive main loop, gtk_dialog_run  callsgtk_widget_show  on the dialog for you. Note that you stillneed to show any children of the dialog yourself.During gtk_dialog_run , the default behavior of ?delete-event?is disabled; if the dialog receives ::delete_event, it will not bedestroyed as windows usually are, and gtk_dialog_run  will returnGTK_RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT. Also, during gtk_dialog_run  the dialogwill be modal. You can force gtk_dialog_run  to return at any time bycalling gtk_dialog_response  to emit the ::response signal. Destroyingthe dialog during gtk_dialog_run  is a very bad idea, because yourpost-run code won?t know whether the dialog was destroyed or not.After gtk_dialog_run  returns, you are responsible for hiding ordestroying the dialog if you wish to do so.Typical usage of this function might be:                    1234567891011[/syntax]        [syntax]gint result = gtk_dialog_run (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));switch (result)  {    case GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT:       do_application_specific_something  ;       break;    default:       do_nothing_since_dialog_was_cancelled  ;       break;  }gtk_widget_destroy (dialog);[/syntax]      
      Note that even though the recursive main loop gives the effect of amodal dialog (it prevents the user from interacting with otherwindows in the same window group while the dialog is run), callbackssuch as timeouts, IO channel watches, DND drops, etc, willbe triggered during a gtk_dialog_run  call.

If the windowis below, events in windows of child widgets will first got to thatwidget, and then to its parents.The default is to keep the window below the child.
Syntax
Parameters
event_box    	a GtkEventBox
above_child    	TRUE if the event box window is above its child

Syntax
Parameters
event_box    	a GtkEventBox
Returns
 TRUE if the event box window is above thewindow of its child
Since 2.4

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_event_box_set_visible_window ----
gtk_event_box_set_visible_window 
Set whether the event box uses a visible or invisible childwindow. The default is to use visible windows.In an invisible window event box, the window that theevent box creates is a GDK_INPUT_ONLY window, whichmeans that it is invisible and only serves to receiveevents.A visible window event box creates a visible (GDK_INPUT_OUTPUT)window that acts as the parent window for all the widgetscontained in the event box.You should generally make your event box invisible ifyou just want to trap events. Creating a visible windowmay cause artifacts that are visible to the user, especiallyif the user is using a theme with gradients or pixmaps.The main reason to create a non input-only event box is ifyou want to set the background to a different color ordraw on it.There is one unexpected issue for an invisible event box that has itswindow below the child. (See gtk_event_box_set_above_child .)Since the input-only window is not an ancestor window of any windowsthat descendent widgets of the event box create, events on thesewindows aren?t propagated up by the windowing system, but only by GTK+.The practical effect of this is if an event isn?t in the eventmask for the descendant window (see gtk_widget_add_events ),it won?t be received by the event box.This problem doesn?t occur for visible event boxes, because inthat case, the event box window is actually the ancestor of thedescendant windows, not just at the same place on the screen.
Syntax
Parameters
event_box    	a GtkEventBox
visible_window    	TRUE to make the event box have a visible window

Since 2.4

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_file_chooser_set_filename ----
gtk_file_chooser_set_filename 
Sets filename as the current filename for the file chooser, by changing tothe file?s parent folder and actually selecting the file in list; all otherfiles will be unselected.  If the chooser is inGTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE mode, the file?s base name will also appear inthe dialog?s file name entry.Note that the file must exist, or nothing will be done exceptfor the directory change.You should use this function only when implementing a savedialog for which you already have a file name to whichthe user may save.  For example, when the user opens an existing file andthen does Save As... to save a copy ora modified version.  If you don?t have a file name already ? forexample, if the user just created a new file and is saving it for the firsttime, do not call this function.  Instead, use something similar to this:                    12345678910[/syntax]        [syntax]if (document_is_new)  {    // the user just created a new document    gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, "Untitled document");  }else  {    // the user edited an existing document    gtk_file_chooser_set_filename (chooser, existing_filename);  }[/syntax]      
      In the first case, the file chooser will present the user with useful suggestionsas to where to save his new file.  In the second case, the file?s existing locationis already known, so the file chooser will use it.

filename    	 the full path of the new current folder. [type filename]
Returns
 Not useful.
Since 2.4

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_file_chooser_get_current_folder ----

Gets the current folder of chooser as a local filename.See gtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder .Note that this is the folder that the file chooser is currently displaying(e.g. "/home/username/Documents"), which is not the sameas the currently-selected folder if the chooser is inGTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SELECT_FOLDER mode(e.g. "/home/username/Documents/selected-folder/".  To get thecurrently-selected folder in that mode, use gtk_file_chooser_get_uri  as theusual way to get the selection.
Syntax
Parameters
chooser    	a GtkFileChooser
Returns
 the full path of the current folder,or NULL if the current path cannot be represented as a localfilename.  Free with g_free .  This function will also returnNULL if the file chooser was unable to load the last folder thatwas requested from it; for example, as would be for callinggtk_file_chooser_set_current_folder  on a nonexistent folder. [type filename]
Since 2.4

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_file_chooser_get_uri ----
gtk_file_chooser_get_uri 
Gets the URI for the currently selected file inthe file selector. If multiple files are selected,one of the filenames will be returned at random.If the file chooser is in folder mode, this function returns the selectedfolder.
Syntax
Parameters
chooser    	a GtkFileChooser
Returns
 The currently selected URI, or NULLif no file is selected. If gtk_file_chooser_set_local_only  is set to TRUE(the default) a local URI will be returned for any FUSE locations.Free with g_free 
Since 2.4

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_file_chooser_set_uri ----
gtk_file_chooser_set_uri 
Sets the file referred to by uri as the current file for the file chooser,by changing to the URI?s parent folder and actually selecting the URI in thelist.  If the chooser is GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE mode, the URI?s basename will also appear in the dialog?s file name entry.Note that the URI must exist, or nothing will be done except for the directory change.You should use this function only when implementing a savedialog for which you already have a file name to whichthe user may save.  For example, when the user opens an existing file and thendoes Save As... to save a copy or amodified version.  If you don?t have a file name already ? for example,if the user just created a new file and is saving it for the first time, donot call this function.  Instead, use something similar to this:                    12345678910[/syntax]        [syntax]if (document_is_new)  {    // the user just created a new document    gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, "Untitled document");  }else  {    // the user edited an existing document    gtk_file_chooser_set_uri (chooser, existing_uri);  }[/syntax]      
      In the first case, the file chooser will present the user with useful suggestionsas to where to save his new file.  In the second case, the file?s existing locationis already known, so the file chooser will use it.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_header_bar_set_decoration_layout ----
gtk_header_bar_set_decoration_layout 
Sets the decoration layout for this header bar, overridingthe ?gtk-decoration-layout? setting. There can be valid reasons for overriding the setting, suchas a header bar design that does not allow for buttons to takeroom on the right, or only offers room for a single close button.Split header bars are another example for overriding thesetting.The format of the string is button names, separated by commas.A colon separates the buttons that should appear on the leftfrom those on the right. Recognized button names are minimize,maximize, close, icon (the window icon) and menu (a menu buttonfor the fallback app menu).For example, ?menu:minimize,maximize,close? specifies a menuon the left, and minimize, maximize and close buttons on the right.

Syntax
Parameters
icon_info    	a GtkIconInfo
Returns
 the built-in image pixbuf, or NULL. Noextra reference is added to the returned pixbuf, so ifyou want to keep it around, you must use g_object_ref .The returned image must not be modified. [transfer none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_icon_info_load_icon ----
gtk_icon_info_load_icon 
Renders an icon previously looked up in an icon theme usinggtk_icon_theme_lookup_icon ; the size will be based on the sizepassed to gtk_icon_theme_lookup_icon . Note that the resultingpixbuf may not be exactly this size; an icon theme may have iconsthat differ slightly from their nominal sizes, and in addition GTK+will avoid scaling icons that it considers sufficiently close to therequested size or for which the source image would have to be scaledup too far. (This maintains sharpness.). This behaviour can be changedby passing the GTK_ICON_LOOKUP_FORCE_SIZE flag when obtainingthe GtkIconInfo. If this flag has been specified, the pixbufreturned by this function will be scaled to the exact size.
Syntax
Parameters
icon_info    	a GtkIconInfo from gtk_icon_theme_lookup_icon

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_icon_info_load_surface ----
gtk_icon_info_load_surface 
Renders an icon previously looked up in an icon theme usinggtk_icon_theme_lookup_icon ; the size will be based on the sizepassed to gtk_icon_theme_lookup_icon . Note that the resultingsurface may not be exactly this size; an icon theme may have iconsthat differ slightly from their nominal sizes, and in addition GTK+will avoid scaling icons that it considers sufficiently close to therequested size or for which the source image would have to be scaledup too far. (This maintains sharpness.). This behaviour can be changedby passing the GTK_ICON_LOOKUP_FORCE_SIZE flag when obtainingthe GtkIconInfo. If this flag has been specified, the pixbufreturned by this function will be scaled to the exact size.
Syntax
Parameters
icon_info    	a GtkIconInfo from gtk_icon_theme_lookup_icon

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_icon_view_scroll_to_path ----
gtk_icon_view_scroll_to_path 
Moves the alignments of icon_view to the position specified by path.  row_align determines where the row is placed, and col_align determines where column is placed.  Both are expected to be between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 means left/top alignment, 1.0 means right/bottom alignment, 0.5 means center.If use_align is FALSE, then the alignment arguments are ignored, and thetree does the minimum amount of work to scroll the item onto the screen.This means that the item will be scrolled to the edge closest to its currentposition.  If the item is currently visible on the screen, nothing is done.This function only works if the model is set, and path is a valid row on the model. If the model changes before the icon_view is realized, the centered path will be modified to reflect this change.
Syntax
Parameters
icon_view    	A GtkIconView.
path    	The path of the item to move to.
use_align    	whether to use alignment arguments, or FALSE.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_icon_view_set_reorderable ----
gtk_icon_view_set_reorderable 
This function is a convenience function to allow you to reorder models thatsupport the GtkTreeDragSourceIface and the GtkTreeDragDestIface.  BothGtkTreeStore and GtkListStore support these.  If reorderable is TRUE, thenthe user can reorder the model by dragging and dropping rows.  Thedeveloper can listen to these changes by connecting to the model'srow_inserted and row_deleted signals. The reordering is implemented by setting upthe icon view as a drag source and destination. Therefore, drag anddrop can not be used in a reorderable view for any other purpose.This function does not give you any degree of control over the order -- anyreordering is allowed.  If more control is needed, you should probablyhandle drag and drop manually.

Syntax
Parameters
context    	a GtkIMContext 
text    	text surrounding the insertion point, as UTF-8.the preedit string should not be included withintext.
len    	the length of text, or -1 if textis nul-terminated
cursor_index    	the byte index of the insertion cursor within text.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_im_context_get_surrounding ----
gtk_im_context_get_surrounding 
Retrieves context around the insertion point. Input methodstypically want context in order to constrain input text based onexisting text; this is important for languages such as Thai whereonly some sequences of characters are allowed.This function is implemented by emitting theGtkIMContext::retrieve_surrounding signal on the input method; inresponse to this signal, a widget should provide as much context asis available, up to an entire paragraph, by callinggtk_im_context_set_surrounding . Note that there is no obligationfor a widget to respond to the ::retrieve_surrounding signal, so inputmethods must be prepared to function without context.
Syntax
Parameters
context    	a GtkIMContext
text    	 location to store a UTF-8 encodedstring of text holding context around the insertion point.If the function returns TRUE, then you must free the resultstored in this location with g_free . [out][transfer full]

Returns
 TRUE if surrounding text was provided; in this caseyou must free the result stored in *text.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_im_context_delete_surrounding ----
gtk_im_context_delete_surrounding 
Asks the widget that the input context is attached to to deletecharacters around the cursor position by emitting theGtkIMContext::delete_surrounding signal. Note that offset and n_charsare in characters not in bytes which differs from the usage otherplaces in GtkIMContext.In order to use this function, you should first callgtk_im_context_get_surrounding  to get the current context, andcall this function immediately afterwards to make sure that youknow what you are deleting. You should also account for the factthat even if the signal was handled, the input context might nothave deleted all the characters that were requested to be deleted.This function is used by an input method that wants to makesubsitutions in the existing text in response to new input. It isnot useful for applications.
Syntax
Parameters
context    	a GtkIMContext
offset    	offset from cursor position in chars;a negative value means start before the cursor.
n_chars    	number of characters to delete.
Returns
 TRUE if the signal was handled

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_label_get_layout_offsets ----
gtk_label_get_layout_offsets 
Obtains the coordinates where the label will draw the PangoLayoutrepresenting the text in the label; useful to convert mouse eventsinto coordinates inside the PangoLayout, e.g. to take some actionif some part of the label is clicked. Of course you will need tocreate a GtkEventBox to receive the events, and pack the labelinside it, since labels are a GTK_NO_WINDOW widget. Rememberwhen using the PangoLayout functions you need to convert toand from pixels using PANGO_PIXELS  or PANGO_SCALE.
Syntax
Parameters

Syntax
Parameters
label    	a GtkLabel
Returns
 the text in the label widget. This is the internalstring used by the label, and must not be modified.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ----
gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic 
Creates a new GtkLabel, containing the text in str.If characters in str are preceded by an underscore, they areunderlined. If you need a literal underscore character in a label, use'__' (two underscores). The first underlined character represents a keyboard accelerator called a mnemonic. The mnemonic key can be used to activate another widget, chosen automatically, or explicitly usinggtk_label_set_mnemonic_widget .If gtk_label_set_mnemonic_widget  is not called, then the first activatable ancestor of the GtkLabel will be chosen as the mnemonic widget. For instance, if the label is inside a button or menu item, the button or menu item will automatically become the mnemonic widget and be activated by the mnemonic.
Syntax
Parameters
str    	 The text of the label, with an underscore in front of themnemonic character. [allow-none]
Returns
 the new GtkLabel

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_label_select_region ----

If the label has been set so that it has an mnemonic key (usingi.e. gtk_label_set_markup_with_mnemonic ,gtk_label_set_text_with_mnemonic , gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic or the ?use_underline? property) the label can be associated with awidget that is the target of the mnemonic. When the label is insidea widget (like a GtkButton or a GtkNotebook tab) it isautomatically associated with the correct widget, but sometimes(i.e. when the target is a GtkEntry next to the label) you need toset it explicitly using this function.The target widget will be accelerated by emitting the GtkWidget::mnemonic-activate signal on it. The default handler for this signal will activate the widget if there are no mnemonic collisions and toggle focus between the colliding widgets otherwise.

Syntax
Parameters
list_box    	An GtkListBox.
row    	a GtkListBoxRow
Since 3.10

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_list_box_drag_unhighlight_row ----

Since 3.10

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_list_box_row_changed ----
gtk_list_box_row_changed 
Marks row as changed, causing any state that depends on thisto be updated. This affects sorting, filtering and headers.Note that calls to this method must be in sync with the dataused for the row functions. For instance, if the list ismirroring some external data set, and *two* rows changed in theexternal data set then when you call gtk_list_box_row_changed on the first row the sort function must only read the new datafor the first of the two changed rows, otherwise the resortingof the rows will be wrong.This generally means that if you don?t fully control the datamodel you have to duplicate the data that affects the listboxrow functions into the row widgets themselves. Another alternativeis to call gtk_list_box_invalidate_sort  on any model change,but that is more expensive.

The row will be empty afterthis function is called.  To fill in values, you need to callgtk_list_store_set  or gtk_list_store_set_value .
Syntax
Parameters
list_store    	A GtkListStore
iter    	 An unset GtkTreeIter to set to the new row. [out]
position    	position to insert the new row, or -1 for last

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_list_store_insert_before ----

Inserts a new row before sibling. If sibling is NULL, then the row will be appended to the end of the list. iter will be changed to point to this new row. The row will be empty after this function is called. To fill in values, you need to call gtk_list_store_set  or gtk_list_store_set_value .
Syntax
Parameters
list_store    	A GtkListStore
iter    	 An unset GtkTreeIter to set to the new row. [out]
sibling    	 A valid GtkTreeIter, or NULL. [allow-none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_list_store_insert_after ----
gtk_list_store_insert_after 
Inserts a new row after sibling. If sibling is NULL, then the row will beprepended to the beginning of the list. iter will be changed to point tothis new row. The row will be empty after this function is called. To fillin values, you need to call gtk_list_store_set  or gtk_list_store_set_value .
Syntax
Parameters
list_store    	A GtkListStore
iter    	 An unset GtkTreeIter to set to the new row. [out]
sibling    	 A valid GtkTreeIter, or NULL. [allow-none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_list_store_insert_with_values ----
gtk_list_store_insert_with_values 
Creates a new row at position. iter will be changed to point to this newrow. If position is -1, or larger than the number of rows in the list, thenthe new row will be appended to the list. The row will be filled with thevalues given to this function.Callinggtk_list_store_insert_with_values (list_store, iter, position...)has the same effect as calling                    12[/syntax]        [syntax]gtk_list_store_insert (list_store, iter, position);gtk_list_store_set (list_store, iter, ...);[/syntax]      
      with the difference that the former will only emit a row_inserted signal,while the latter will emit row_inserted, row_changed and, if the list storeis sorted, rows_reordered. Since emitting the rows_reordered signalrepeatedly can affect the performance of the program,gtk_list_store_insert_with_values  should generally be preferred wheninserting rows in a sorted list store.
Syntax
Parameters
list_store    	A GtkListStore
iter    	 An unset GtkTreeIter to set to the new row, or NULL. [out][allow-none]
position    	position to insert the new row, or -1 to append after existingrows

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_menu_set_accel_path ----
gtk_menu_set_accel_path 
Sets an accelerator path for this menu from which accelerator pathsfor its immediate children, its menu items, can be constructed.The main purpose of this function is to spare the programmer theinconvenience of having to call gtk_menu_item_set_accel_path  oneach menu item that should support runtime user changable accelerators.Instead, by just calling gtk_menu_set_accel_path  on their parent,each menu item of this menu, that contains a label describing itspurpose, automatically gets an accel path assigned.For example, a menu containing menu items ?New? and ?Exit?, will, aftergtk_menu_set_accel_path (menu, "<Gnumeric-Sheet>/File"); has beencalled, assign its items the accel paths: "<Gnumeric-Sheet>/File/New"and "<Gnumeric-Sheet>/File/Exit".Assigning accel paths to menu items then enables the user to changetheir accelerators at runtime. More details about accelerator pathsand their default setups can be found at gtk_accel_map_add_entry .Note that accel_path string will be stored in a GQuark. Therefore,if you pass a static string, you can save some memory by interningit first with g_intern_static_string .

------------ KeyGTK3GtkMenuPositionFunc ----
GtkMenuPositionFunc 
A user function supplied when calling gtk_menu_popup  whichcontrols the positioning of the menu when it is displayed.  Thefunction sets the x and y parameters to the coordinates where themenu is to be drawn.  To make the menu appear on a differentmonitor than the mouse pointer, gtk_menu_set_monitor  must becalled.
Syntax
Parameters
menu    	a GtkMenu.
x    	 address of the gint representing the horizontalposition where the menu shall be drawn. [out]
y    	 address of the gint representing the vertical positionwhere the menu shall be drawn.  This is an output parameter. [out]
push_in    	 This parameter controls how menus placed outsidethe monitor are handled.  If this is set to TRUE and part ofthe menu is outside the monitor then GTK+ pushes the windowinto the visible area, effectively modifying the popupposition.  Note that moving and possibly resizing the menuaround will alter the scroll position to keep the menu items?in place?, i.e. at the same monitor position they would havebeen without resizing.  In practice, this behavior is onlyuseful for combobox popups or option menus and cannot be usedto simply confine a menu to monitor boundaries.  In that case,changing the scroll offset is not desirable. [out]
user_data    	the data supplied by the user in the gtk_menu_popup dataparameter.

------------ KeyGTK3GtkMenuDetachFunc ----

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_menu_shell_set_take_focus ----
gtk_menu_shell_set_take_focus 
If take_focus is TRUE (the default) the menu shell will takethe keyboard focus so that it will receive all keyboard eventswhich is needed to enable keyboard navigation in menus.Setting take_focus to FALSE is useful only for special applicationslike virtual keyboard implementations which should not take keyboardfocus.The take_focus state of a menu or menu bar is automaticallypropagated to submenus whenever a submenu is popped up, so youdon?t have to worry about recursively setting it for your entiremenu hierarchy. Only when programmatically picking a submenu andpopping it up manually, the take_focus property of the submenuneeds to be set explicitly.Note that setting it to FALSE has side-effects:If the focus is in some other app, it keeps the focus and keynav inthe menu doesn?t work. Consequently, keynav on the menu will onlywork if the focus is on some toplevel owned by the onscreen keyboard.To avoid confusing the user, menus with take_focus set to FALSEshould not display mnemonics or accelerators, since it cannot beguaranteed that they will work.See also gdk_keyboard_grab 
Syntax
Parameters
menu_shell    	a GtkMenuShell
take_focus    	TRUE if the menu shell should take the keyboardfocus on popup
Since 2.8

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_menu_shell_bind_model ----
gtk_menu_shell_bind_model 
Establishes a binding between a GtkMenuShell and a GMenuModel.The contents of shell are removed and then refilled with menu itemsaccording to model.  When model changes, shell is updated.Calling this function twice on shell with different model willcause the first binding to be replaced with a binding to the newmodel. If model is NULL then any previous binding is undone andall children are removed.with_separators determines if toplevel items (eg: sections) haveseparators inserted between them.  This is typically desired formenus but doesn?t make sense for menubars.If action_namespace is non-NULL then the effect is as if allactions mentioned in the model have their names prefixed with thenamespace, plus a dot.  For example, if the action ?quit? ismentioned and action_namespace is ?app? then the effective actionname is ?app.quit?.This function uses GtkActionable to define the action name andtarget values on the created menu items.  If you want to use anaction group other than ?app? and ?win?, or if you want to use aGtkMenuShell outside of a GtkApplicationWindow, then you will needto attach your own action group to the widget hierarchy usinggtk_widget_insert_action_group .  As an example, if you created agroup with a ?quit? action and inserted it with the name ?mygroup?then you would use the action name ?mygroup.quit? in yourGMenuModel.For most cases you are probably better off usinggtk_menu_new_from_model  or gtk_menu_bar_new_from_model  or justdirectly passing the GMenuModel to gtk_application_set_app_menu  orgtk_application_set_menubar .
Syntax
Parameters
menu_shell    	a GtkMenuShell

Establishes a binding between a GtkPopover and a GMenuModel.The contents of popover are removed and then refilled with menu itemsaccording to model.  When model changes, popover is updated.Calling this function twice on popover with different model willcause the first binding to be replaced with a binding to the newmodel. If model is NULL then any previous binding is undone andall children are removed.If action_namespace is non-NULL then the effect is as if allactions mentioned in the model have their names prefixed with thenamespace, plus a dot.  For example, if the action ?quit? ismentioned and action_namespace is ?app? then the effective actionname is ?app.quit?.This function uses GtkActionable to define the action name andtarget values on the created menu items.  If you want to use anaction group other than ?app? and ?win?, or if you want to use aGtkMenuShell outside of a GtkApplicationWindow, then you will needto attach your own action group to the widget hierarchy usinggtk_widget_insert_action_group .  As an example, if you created agroup with a ?quit? action and inserted it with the name ?mygroup?then you would use the action name ?mygroup.quit? in yourGMenuModel.

In that use case, the value of the rangewould indicate the current play position, and the fill level wouldbe the position up to which the file/stream has been downloaded.This amount of prebuffering can be displayed on the range?s troughand is themeable separately from the trough. To enable fill leveldisplay, use gtk_range_set_show_fill_level . The range defaultsto not showing the fill level.Additionally, it?s possible to restrict the range?s slider positionto values which are smaller than the fill level. This is controllerby gtk_range_set_restrict_to_fill_level  and is by defaultenabled.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_scrolled_window_add_with_viewport ----
gtk_scrolled_window_add_with_viewport 
gtk_scrolled_window_add_with_viewport has been deprecated since version 3.8 and should not be used in newly-written code.gtk_container_add  will now automatically adda GtkViewport if the child doesn?t implement GtkScrollable.Used to add children without native scrolling capabilities. Thisis simply a convenience function; it is equivalent to adding theunscrollable child to a viewport, then adding the viewport to thescrolled window. If a child has native scrolling, usegtk_container_add  instead of this function.The viewport scrolls the child by moving its GdkWindow, and takesthe size of the child to be the size of its toplevel GdkWindow. This will be very wrong for most widgets that support native scrolling;for example, if you add a widget such as GtkTreeView with a viewport,the whole widget will scroll, including the column headings. Thus, widgets with native scrolling support should not be used with the GtkViewport proxy.A widget supports scrolling natively if it implements theGtkScrollable interface.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_style_context_notify_state_change ----
gtk_style_context_notify_state_change 
gtk_style_context_notify_state_change has been deprecated since version 3.6 and should not be used in newly-written code.This function does nothing.Notifies a state change on context, so if the current style makes useof transition animations, one will be started so all rendered elementsunder region_id are animated for state state being set to valuestate_value.The window parameter is used in order to invalidate the rendered areaas the animation runs, so make sure it is the same window that is beingrendered on by the gtk_render_*  functions.If region_id is NULL, all rendered elements using context will beaffected by this state transition.As a practical example, a GtkButton notifying a state transition onthe prelight state:                    12345[/syntax]        [syntax]gtk_style_context_notify_state_change (context,                                       gtk_widget_get_window (widget),                                       NULL,                                       GTK_STATE_PRELIGHT,                                       button->in_button);[/syntax]      
      Can be handled in the CSS file like this:                    12345678[/syntax]        [syntax]GtkButton {    background-color: #f00}GtkButton:hover {    background-color: #fff;    transition: 200ms linear}[/syntax]      
      This combination will animate the button background from red to whiteif a pointer enters the button, and back to red if the pointer leavesthe button.Note that state is used when finding the transition parameters, whichis why the style places the transition under the :hover pseudo-class.
Syntax
Parameters
context    	a GtkStyleContext

Inserts len bytes of text at position iter.  If len is -1,text must be nul-terminated and will be inserted in itsentirety. Emits the ?insert-text? signal; insertion actually occursin the default handler for the signal. iter is invalidated wheninsertion occurs (because the buffer contents change), but thedefault signal handler revalidates it to point to the end of theinserted text.
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
iter    	a position in the buffer
text    	text in UTF-8 format
len    	length of text in bytes, or -1

Usually youwant to prevent insertions at ineditable locations if the insertionresults from a user action (is interactive).default_editable indicates the editability of text that doesn'thave a tag affecting editability applied to it. Typically theresult of gtk_text_view_get_editable  is appropriate here.
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
iter    	a position in buffer
text    	some UTF-8 text
len    	length of text in bytes, or -1
default_editable    	default editability of buffer

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_insert_range ----
gtk_text_buffer_insert_range 
Copies text, tags, and pixbufs between start and end (the orderof start and end doesn?t matter) and inserts the copy at iter.Used instead of simply getting/inserting text because it preservesimages and tags. If start and end are in a different buffer frombuffer, the two buffers must share the same tag table.Implemented via emissions of the insert_text and apply_tag signals,so expect those.
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
iter    	a position in buffer
start    	a position in a GtkTextBuffer
end    	another position in the same buffer as start

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_insert_range_interactive ----
gtk_text_buffer_insert_range_interactive 
Same as gtk_text_buffer_insert_range , but does nothing if theinsertion point isn?t editable. The default_editable parameterindicates whether the text is editable at iter if no tagsenclosing iter affect editability. Typically the result ofgtk_text_view_get_editable  is appropriate here.
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
iter    	a position in buffer
start    	a position in a GtkTextBuffer
end    	another position in the same buffer as start
default_editable    	default editability of the buffer
Returns
 whether an insertion was possible at iter

Deletes text between start and end. The order of start and endis not actually relevant; gtk_text_buffer_delete  will reorderthem. This function actually emits the ?delete-range? signal, andthe default handler of that signal deletes the text. Because thebuffer is modified, all outstanding iterators become invalid aftercalling this function; however, the start and end will bere-initialized to point to the location where text was deleted.
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
start    	a position in buffer
end    	another position in buffer

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_delete_interactive ----

Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
start_iter    	start of range to delete
end_iter    	end of range
default_editable    	whether the buffer is editable by default
Returns
 whether some text was actually deleted

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_backspace ----
gtk_text_buffer_backspace 
Performs the appropriate action as if the user hit the deletekey with the cursor at the position specified by iter. In thenormal case a single character will be deleted, but whencombining accents are involved, more than one character canbe deleted, and when precomposed character and accent combinationsare involved, less than one character will be deleted.Because the buffer is modified, all outstanding iterators become invalid after calling this function; however, the iter will bere-initialized to point to the location where text was deleted.
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
iter    	a position in buffer
interactive    	whether the deletion is caused by user interaction
default_editable    	whether the buffer is editable by default
Returns
 TRUE if the buffer was modified
Since 2.6

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_set_text ----
gtk_text_buffer_set_text 
Deletes current contents of buffer, and inserts text instead. Iflen is -1, text must be nul-terminated. text must be valid UTF-8.
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
text    	UTF-8 text to insert
len    	length of textin bytes

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_get_text ----
gtk_text_buffer_get_text 
Returns the text in the range [start,end). Excludes undisplayedtext (text marked with tags that set the invisibility attribute) ifinclude_hidden_chars is FALSE. Does not include charactersrepresenting embedded images, so byte and character indexes intothe returned string do not correspond to byteand character indexes into the buffer. Contrast withgtk_text_buffer_get_slice .
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
start    	start of a range
end    	end of a range
include_hidden_chars    	whether to include invisible text
Returns
 an allocated UTF-8 string

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_get_slice ----
gtk_text_buffer_get_slice 
Returns the text in the range [start,end). Excludes undisplayedtext (text marked with tags that set the invisibility attribute) ifinclude_hidden_chars is FALSE. The returned string includes a0xFFFC character whenever the buffer containsembedded images, so byte and character indexes intothe returned string do correspond to byteand character indexes into the buffer. Contrast withgtk_text_buffer_get_text . Note that 0xFFFC can occur in normaltext as well, so it is not a reliable indicator that a pixbuf orwidget is in the buffer.
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
start    	start of a range
end    	end of a range
include_hidden_chars    	whether to include invisible text
Returns
 an allocated UTF-8 string

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_insert_pixbuf ----
gtk_text_buffer_insert_pixbuf 
Inserts an image into the text buffer at iter. The image will becounted as one character in character counts, and when obtainingthe buffer contents as a string, will be represented by the Unicode?object replacement character? 0xFFFC. Note that the ?slice?variants for obtaining portions of the buffer as a string includethis character for pixbufs, but the ?text? variants donot. e.g. see gtk_text_buffer_get_slice  andgtk_text_buffer_get_text .
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
iter    	location to insert the pixbuf
pixbuf    	a GdkPixbuf

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_insert_child_anchor ----
gtk_text_buffer_insert_child_anchor 
Inserts a child widget anchor into the text buffer at iter. Theanchor will be counted as one character in character counts, andwhen obtaining the buffer contents as a string, will be representedby the Unicode ?object replacement character? 0xFFFC. Note that the?slice? variants for obtaining portions of the buffer as a stringinclude this character for child anchors, but the ?text? variants donot. E.g. see gtk_text_buffer_get_slice  andgtk_text_buffer_get_text . Considergtk_text_buffer_create_child_anchor  as a more convenientalternative to this function. The buffer will add a reference tothe anchor, so you can unref it after insertion.
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
iter    	location to insert the anchor
anchor    	a GtkTextChildAnchor

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_create_child_anchor ----
gtk_text_buffer_create_child_anchor 
This is a convenience function which simply creates a child anchorwith gtk_text_child_anchor_new  and inserts it into the bufferwith gtk_text_buffer_insert_child_anchor . The new anchor isowned by the buffer; no reference count is returned tothe caller of gtk_text_buffer_create_child_anchor .
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
iter    	location in the buffer
Returns
 the created child anchor. [transfer none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_create_mark ----
gtk_text_buffer_create_mark 
Creates a mark at position where. If mark_name is NULL, the markis anonymous; otherwise, the mark can be retrieved by name usinggtk_text_buffer_get_mark . If a mark has left gravity, and text isinserted at the mark?s current location, the mark will be moved tothe left of the newly-inserted text. If the mark has right gravity(left_gravity = FALSE), the mark will end up on the right ofnewly-inserted text. The standard left-to-right cursor is a markwith right gravity (when you type, the cursor stays on the rightside of the text you?re typing).The caller of this function does not own a reference to the returned GtkTextMark, so you can ignore the return value if you like. Marks are owned by the buffer and go away when the buffer does.Emits the ?mark-set? signal as notification of the mark'sinitial placement.
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
mark_name    	 name for mark, or NULL. [allow-none]
where    	location to place mark
left_gravity    	whether the mark has left gravity
Returns
 the new GtkTextMark object. [transfer none]

Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
mark    	the mark to add
where    	location to place mark
Since 2.12

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_delete_mark ----
gtk_text_buffer_delete_mark 
Deletes mark, so that it?s no longer located anywhere in thebuffer. Removes the reference the buffer holds to the mark, so ifyou haven?t called g_object_ref  on the mark, it will be freed. Evenif the mark isn?t freed, most operations on mark becomeinvalid, until it gets added to a buffer again with gtk_text_buffer_add_mark . Use gtk_text_mark_get_deleted  to  find out if a mark has been removed from its buffer.The ?mark-deleted? signal will be emitted as notification afterthe mark is deleted.
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
mark    	a GtkTextMark in buffer

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_delete_mark_by_name ----

gtk_text_buffer_begin_user_action 
Called to indicate that the buffer operations between here and acall to gtk_text_buffer_end_user_action  are part of a singleuser-visible operation. The operations betweengtk_text_buffer_begin_user_action  andgtk_text_buffer_end_user_action  can then be grouped when creatingan undo stack. GtkTextBuffer maintains a count of calls togtk_text_buffer_begin_user_action  that have not been closed witha call to gtk_text_buffer_end_user_action , and emits the ?begin-user-action? and ?end-user-action? signals only for the outermost pair of calls. This allows you to build user actions from other user actions.The ?interactive? buffer mutation functions, such asgtk_text_buffer_insert_interactive , automatically call begin/enduser action around the buffer operations they perform, so there'sno need to add extra calls if you user action consists solely of asingle call to one of those functions.
Syntax

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_deserialize_set_can_create_tags ----
gtk_text_buffer_deserialize_set_can_create_tags 
Use this function to allow a rich text deserialization function tocreate new tags in the receiving buffer. Note that using thisfunction is almost always a bad idea, because the rich textfunctions you register should know how to map the rich text formatthey handler to your text buffers set of tags.The ability of creating new (arbitrary!) tags in the receiving bufferis meant for special rich text formats like the internal one thatis registered using gtk_text_buffer_register_deserialize_tagset ,because that format is essentially a dump of the internal structureof the source buffer, including its tag names.You should allow creation of tags only if you know what you aredoing, e.g. if you defined a tagset name for your applicationsuite?s text buffers and you know that it?s fine to receive newtags from these buffers, because you know that your application canhandle the newly created tags.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_register_deserialize_tagset ----
gtk_text_buffer_register_deserialize_tagset 
This function registers GTK+?s internal rich text serializationformat with the passed buffer. Seegtk_text_buffer_register_serialize_tagset  for details.
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
tagset_name    	 an optional tagset name, on NULL. [allow-none]
Returns
 the GdkAtom that corresponds to thenewly registered format?s mime-type. [transfer none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_register_serialize_format ----
gtk_text_buffer_register_serialize_format 
This function registers a rich text serialization function along withits mime_type with the passed buffer.
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
mime_type    	the format?s mime-type
function    	the serialize function to register
user_data    	function?s user_data
user_data_destroy    	a function to call when user_datais no longer needed
Returns
 the GdkAtom that corresponds to thenewly registered format?s mime-type. [transfer none]
Since 2.10

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_buffer_register_serialize_tagset ----
gtk_text_buffer_register_serialize_tagset 
This function registers GTK+?s internal rich text serializationformat with the passed buffer. The internal format does not complyto any standard rich text format and only works between GtkTextBufferinstances. It is capable of serializing all of a text buffer?s tagsand embedded pixbufs.This function is just a wrapper aroundgtk_text_buffer_register_serialize_format . The mime type usedfor registering is ?application/x-gtk-text-buffer-rich-text?, or?application/x-gtk-text-buffer-rich-text;format=tagset_name? if atagset_name was passed.The tagset_name can be used to restrict the transfer of rich textto buffers with compatible sets of tags, in order to avoid unknowntags from being pasted. It is probably the common case to pass anidentifier != NULL here, since the NULL tagset requires thereceiving buffer to deal with with pasting of arbitrary tags.
Syntax
Parameters
buffer    	a GtkTextBuffer
tagset_name    	 an optional tagset name, on NULL. [allow-none]
Returns
 the GdkAtom that corresponds to thenewly registered format?s mime-type. [transfer none]
Since 2.10

Returns
 the buffer. [transfer none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_copy ----
gtk_text_iter_copy

Since 3.2

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_free ----
gtk_text_iter_free 
Free an iterator allocated on the heap. This functionis intended for use in language bindings, and is notespecially useful for applications, because iterators cansimply be allocated on the stack.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	a dynamically-allocated iterator

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_offset ----
gtk_text_iter_get_offset 
Returns the character offset of an iterator.Each character in a GtkTextBuffer has an offset,starting with 0 for the first character in the buffer.Use gtk_text_buffer_get_iter_at_offset  to convert anoffset back into an iterator.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
Returns
 a character offset

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_line ----
gtk_text_iter_get_line 
Returns the line number containing the iterator. Lines ina GtkTextBuffer are numbered beginning with 0 for the firstline in the buffer.

 a line number

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_line_offset ----
gtk_text_iter_get_line_offset 
Returns the character offset of the iterator,counting from the start of a newline-terminated line.The first character on the line has offset 0.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
Returns
 offset from start of line

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_line_index ----
gtk_text_iter_get_line_index 
Returns the byte index of the iterator, countingfrom the start of a newline-terminated line.Remember that GtkTextBuffer encodes text inUTF-8, and that characters can require a variablenumber of bytes to represent.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
Returns
 distance from start of line, in bytes

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_visible_line_index ----
gtk_text_iter_get_visible_line_index 
Returns the number of bytes from the start of theline to the given iter, not counting bytes thatare invisible due to tags with the ?invisible? flagtoggled on.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	a GtkTextIter
Returns
 byte index of iterwith respect to the start of the line

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_visible_line_offset ----
gtk_text_iter_get_visible_line_offset 
Returns the offset in characters from the start of theline to the given iter, not counting characters thatare invisible due to tags with the ?invisible? flagtoggled on.

Returns
 offset in visible characters from the start of the line 

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_char ----
gtk_text_iter_get_char 
The Unicode character at this iterator is returned.  (Equivalent tooperator* on a C++ iterator.)  If the element at this iterator is anon-character element, such as an image embedded in the buffer, theUnicode ?unknown? character 0xFFFC is returned. If invoked onthe end iterator, zero is returned; zero is not a valid Unicode character.So you can write a loop which ends when gtk_text_iter_get_char returns 0.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
Returns
 a Unicode character, or 0 if iteris not dereferenceable

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_slice ----
gtk_text_iter_get_slice 
Returns the text in the given range. A ?slice? is an array ofcharacters encoded in UTF-8 format, including the Unicode ?unknown?character 0xFFFC for iterable non-character elements in the buffer,such as images.  Because images are encoded in the slice, byte andcharacter offsets in the returned array will correspond to byteoffsets in the text buffer. Note that 0xFFFC can occur in normaltext as well, so it is not a reliable indicator that a pixbuf orwidget is in the buffer.
Syntax
Parameters
start    	iterator at start of a range
end    	iterator at end of a range
Returns
 slice of text from the buffer

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_text ----
gtk_text_iter_get_text

Syntax
Parameters
start    	iterator at start of a range
end    	iterator at end of a range
Returns
 array of characters from the buffer

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_visible_slice ----
gtk_text_iter_get_visible_slice 
Like gtk_text_iter_get_slice , but invisible text is not included.Invisible text is usually invisible because a GtkTextTag with the?invisible? attribute turned on has been applied to it.
Syntax
Parameters

end    	iterator at end of range
Returns
 slice of text from the buffer

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_visible_text ----
gtk_text_iter_get_visible_text 
Like gtk_text_iter_get_text , but invisible text is not included.Invisible text is usually invisible because a GtkTextTag with the?invisible? attribute turned on has been applied to it.
Syntax
Parameters
start    	iterator at start of range
end    	iterator at end of range
Returns
 string containing visible text in the range

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_pixbuf ----

Returns
 the pixbuf at iter. [transfer none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_marks ----
gtk_text_iter_get_marks

Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
Returns
 list of GtkTextMark. [element-type GtkTextMark][transfer container]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_toggled_tags ----
gtk_text_iter_get_toggled_tags 
Returns a list of GtkTextTag that are toggled on or off at thispoint.  (If toggled_on is TRUE, the list contains tags that aretoggled on.) If a tag is toggled on at iter, then some non-emptyrange of characters following iter has that tag applied to it.  Ifa tag is toggled off, then some non-empty range following iterdoes not have the tag applied to it.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
toggled_on    	TRUE to get toggled-on tags
Returns
 tags toggled at this point. [element-type GtkTextTag][transfer container]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_child_anchor ----

Returns
 the anchor at iter. [transfer none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_begins_tag ----
gtk_text_iter_begins_tag 
Returns TRUE if tag is toggled on at exactly this point. If tagis NULL, returns TRUE if any tag is toggled on at this point.Note that if gtk_text_iter_begins_tag  returns TRUE, it means that iter isat the beginning of the tagged range, and that thecharacter at iter is inside the tagged range. In otherwords, unlike gtk_text_iter_ends_tag , if gtk_text_iter_begins_tag  returnsTRUE, gtk_text_iter_has_tag  will also return TRUE for the sameparameters.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
tag    	 a GtkTextTag, or NULL. [allow-none]
Returns
 whether iteris the start of a range tagged with tag

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_ends_tag ----
gtk_text_iter_ends_tag

In other words,unlike gtk_text_iter_begins_tag , if gtk_text_iter_ends_tag  returns TRUE,gtk_text_iter_has_tag  will return FALSE for the same parameters.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
tag    	 a GtkTextTag, or NULL. [allow-none]
Returns
 whether iteris the end of a range tagged with tag

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_toggles_tag ----

Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
tag    	 a GtkTextTag, or NULL. [allow-none]
Returns
 whether tagis toggled on or off at iter

Returns
 whether iteris tagged with tag

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_get_tags ----
gtk_text_iter_get_tags 
Returns a list of tags that apply to iter, in ascending order ofpriority (highest-priority tags are last). The GtkTextTag in thelist don?t have a reference added, but you have to free the listitself.

Returns
 list of GtkTextTag. [element-type GtkTextTag][transfer container]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_editable ----
gtk_text_iter_editable 
Returns whether the character at iter is within an editable regionof text.  Non-editable text is ?locked? and can?t be changed by theuser via GtkTextView. This function is simply a conveniencewrapper around gtk_text_iter_get_attributes . If no tags appliedto this text affect editability, default_setting will be returned.You don?t want to use this function to decide whether text can beinserted at iter, because for insertion you don?t want to knowwhether the char at iter is inside an editable range, you want toknow whether a new character inserted at iter would be inside aneditable range. Use gtk_text_iter_can_insert  to handle thiscase.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
default_setting    	TRUE if text is editable by default
Returns
 whether iteris inside an editable range

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_can_insert ----
gtk_text_iter_can_insert 
Considering the default editability of the buffer, and tags thataffect editability, determines whether text inserted at iter wouldbe editable. If text inserted at iter would be editable then theuser should be allowed to insert text at iter.gtk_text_buffer_insert_interactive  uses this function to decidewhether insertions are allowed at a given position.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator

Returns
 whether text inserted at iterwould be editable

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_starts_word ----

Returns
 TRUE if iteris inside a word

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_starts_line ----
gtk_text_iter_starts_line 
Returns TRUE if iter begins a paragraph,i.e. if gtk_text_iter_get_line_offset  would return 0.However this function is potentially more efficient thangtk_text_iter_get_line_offset  because it doesn?t have to computethe offset, it just has to see whether it?s 0.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
Returns
 whether iterbegins a line

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_ends_line ----
gtk_text_iter_ends_line 
Returns TRUE if iter points to the start of the paragraphdelimiter characters for a line (delimiters will be either anewline, a carriage return, a carriage return followed by anewline, or a Unicode paragraph separator character). Note that aniterator pointing to the \n of a \r\n pair will not be counted asthe end of a line, the line ends before the \r. The end iterator isconsidered to be at the end of a line, even though there are noparagraph delimiter chars there.

Returns
 whether iteris at the end of a line

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_starts_sentence ----

Sentence boundaries are determinedby Pango and should be correct for nearly any language (if not, thecorrect fix would be to the Pango text boundary algorithms).
Syntax
Parameters

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_forward_char ----
gtk_text_iter_forward_char 
Moves iter forward by one character offset. Note that imagesembedded in the buffer occupy 1 character slot, sogtk_text_iter_forward_char  may actually move onto an image insteadof a character, if you have images in your buffer.  If iter is theend iterator or one character before it, iter will now point atthe end iterator, and gtk_text_iter_forward_char  returns FALSE forconvenience when writing loops.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
Returns
 whether itermoved and is dereferenceable

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_backward_char ----
gtk_text_iter_backward_char 
Moves backward by one character offset. Returns TRUE if movementwas possible; if iter was the first in the buffer (characteroffset 0), gtk_text_iter_backward_char  returns FALSE for convenience whenwriting loops.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
Returns
 whether movement was possible

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_forward_chars ----
gtk_text_iter_forward_chars 
Moves count characters if possible (if count would move past thestart or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end of thebuffer). The return value indicates whether the new position ofiter is different from its original position, and dereferenceable(the last iterator in the buffer is not dereferenceable). If countis 0, the function does nothing and returns FALSE.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
count    	number of characters to move, may be negative
Returns
 whether itermoved and is dereferenceable

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_backward_chars ----
gtk_text_iter_backward_chars 
Moves count characters backward, if possible (if count would movepast the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end ofthe buffer).  The return value indicates whether the iterator movedonto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn?t move, ormoved onto the end iterator, then FALSE is returned. If count is 0,the function does nothing and returns FALSE.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
count    	number of characters to move
Returns
 whether itermoved and is dereferenceable

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_forward_line ----
gtk_text_iter_forward_line 
Moves iter to the start of the next line. If the iter is already on thelast line of the buffer, moves the iter to the end of the current line.If after the operation, the iter is at the end of the buffer and notdereferencable, returns FALSE. Otherwise, returns TRUE.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
Returns
 whether itercan be dereferenced

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_backward_line ----
gtk_text_iter_backward_line 
Moves iter to the start of the previous line. Returns TRUE ifiter could be moved; i.e. if iter was at character offset 0, thisfunction returns FALSE. Therefore if iter was already on line 0,but not at the start of the line, iter is snapped to the start ofthe line and the function returns TRUE. (Note that this implies thatin a loop calling this function, the line number may not change onevery iteration, if your first iteration is on line 0.)
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	an iterator
Returns
 whether itermoved

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_forward_lines ----
gtk_text_iter_forward_lines 
Moves count lines forward, if possible (if count would movepast the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end ofthe buffer).  The return value indicates whether the iterator movedonto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn?t move, ormoved onto the end iterator, then FALSE is returned. If count is 0,the function does nothing and returns FALSE. If count is negative,moves backward by 0 - count lines.
Syntax
Parameters
iter    	a GtkTextIter
count    	number of lines to move forward
Returns
 whether itermoved and is dereferenceable

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_backward_lines ----
gtk_text_iter_backward_lines 
Moves count lines backward, if possible (if count would movepast the start or end of the buffer, moves to the start or end ofthe buffer).  The return value indicates whether the iterator movedonto a dereferenceable position; if the iterator didn?t move, ormoved onto the end iterator, then FALSE is returned. If count is 0,the function does nothing and returns FALSE. If count is negative,moves forward by 0 - count lines.

Returns
 TRUE if itermoved and is not the end iterator 

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_forward_cursor_position ----
gtk_text_iter_forward_cursor_position 
Moves iter forward by a single cursor position. Cursor positionsare (unsurprisingly) positions where the cursor can appear. Perhapssurprisingly, there may not be a cursor position between allcharacters. The most common example for European languages would bea carriage return/newline sequence. For some Unicode characters,the equivalent of say the letter ?a? with an accent mark will berepresented as two characters, first the letter then a "combiningmark" that causes the accent to be rendered; so the cursor can?t gobetween those two characters. See also the PangoLogAttr andpango_break  function.

 TRUE if iteris in the range

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_iter_order ----
gtk_text_iter_order 
Swaps the value of first and second if second comes beforefirst in the buffer. That is, ensures that first and second arein sequence. Most text buffer functions that take a range call thisautomatically on your behalf, so there?s no real reason to call it yourselfin those cases. There are some exceptions, such as gtk_text_iter_in_range ,that expect a pre-sorted range.
Syntax
Parameters
first    	a GtkTextIter
second    	another GtkTextIter[br \=""
------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_mark_new ----
gtk_text_mark_new 
Creates a text mark. Add it to a buffer using gtk_text_buffer_add_mark .If name is NULL, the mark is anonymous; otherwise, the mark can be retrieved by name using gtk_text_buffer_get_mark . If a mark has left gravity, and text is inserted at the mark?s current location, the mark will be moved to the left of the newly-inserted text. If the mark has right gravity (left_gravity = FALSE), the mark will end up on the right of newly-inserted text. The standard left-to-right cursor is a mark with right gravity (when you type, the cursor stays on the rightside of the text you?re typing).
Syntax
Parameters
name    	 mark name or NULL. [allow-none]
left_gravity    	whether the mark should have left gravity
Returns
 new GtkTextMark

Scrolls text_view so that mark is on the screen in the positionindicated by xalign and yalign. An alignment of 0.0 indicatesleft or top, 1.0 indicates right or bottom, 0.5 means center. If use_align is FALSE, the text scrolls the minimal distance to get the mark onscreen, possibly not scrolling at all. The effective screen for purposes of this function is reduced by a margin of size within_margin.
Syntax
Parameters
text_view    	a GtkTextView
mark    	a GtkTextMark
within_margin    	margin as a [0.0,0.5) fraction of screen size
use_align    	whether to use alignment arguments (if FALSE, justget the mark onscreen)
xalign    	horizontal alignment of mark within visible area
yalign    	vertical alignment of mark within visible area

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_text_view_scroll_to_iter ----
gtk_text_view_scroll_to_iter 
Scrolls text_view so that iter is on the screen in the positionindicated by xalign and yalign. An alignment of 0.0 indicatesleft or top, 1.0 indicates right or bottom, 0.5 means center. If use_align is FALSE, the text scrolls the minimal distance to get the mark onscreen, possibly not scrolling at all. The effective screen for purposes of this function is reduced by a margin of size within_margin.Note that this function uses the currently-computed height of thelines in the text buffer. Line heights are computed in an idle handler; so this function may not have the desired effect if it?s called before the height computations. To avoid oddness, consider using gtk_text_view_scroll_to_mark  which saves a point to be scrolled to after line validation.
Syntax
Parameters
text_view    	a GtkTextView
iter    	a GtkTextIter
within_margin    	margin as a [0.0,0.5) fraction of screen size
use_align    	whether to use alignment arguments (if FALSE,just get the mark onscreen)
xalign    	horizontal alignment of mark within visible area
yalign    	vertical alignment of mark within visible area
Returns
 TRUE if scrolling occurred

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_tree_row_reference_new_proxy ----
gtk_tree_row_reference_new_proxy 
You do not need to use this function.Creates a row reference based on path.This reference will keep pointing to the node pointed toby path, so long as it exists. If path isn?t a validpath in model, then NULL is returned. However, unlikereferences created with gtk_tree_row_reference_new , itdoes not listen to the model for changes. The creator ofthe row reference must do this explicitly usinggtk_tree_row_reference_inserted , gtk_tree_row_reference_deleted ,gtk_tree_row_reference_reordered .These functions must be called exactly once per proxy when thecorresponding signal on the model is emitted. This single callupdates all row references for that proxy. Since built-in GTK+objects like GtkTreeView already use this mechanism internally,using them as the proxy object will produce unpredictable results.Further more, passing the same object as model and proxydoesn?t work for reasons of internal implementation.This type of row reference is primarily meant by structures thatneed to carefully monitor exactly when a row reference updatesitself, and is not generally needed by most applications.

If both sibling and parent areset, then parent must be the parent of sibling.  When sibling is set,parent is optional.iter will be changed to point to this new row.  The row will be empty afterthis function is called.  To fill in values, you need to callgtk_tree_store_set  or gtk_tree_store_set_value .
Syntax
Parameters
tree_store    	A GtkTreeStore
iter    	 An unset GtkTreeIter to set to the new row. [out]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_tree_store_insert_with_values ----
gtk_tree_store_insert_with_values 
Creates a new row at position. iter will be changed to point to thisnew row. If position is -1, or larger than the number of rows on the list, thenthe new row will be appended to the list. The row will be filled withthe values given to this function.Callinggtk_tree_store_insert_with_values (tree_store, iter, position, ...)has the same effect as calling                    12[/syntax]        [syntax]gtk_tree_store_insert (tree_store, iter, position);gtk_tree_store_set (tree_store, iter, ...);[/syntax]      
      with the different that the former will only emit a row_inserted signal,while the latter will emit row_inserted, row_changed and if the tree storeis sorted, rows_reordered.  Since emitting the rows_reordered signalrepeatedly can affect the performance of the program,gtk_tree_store_insert_with_values  should generally be preferred wheninserting rows in a sorted tree store.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_tree_view_set_column_drag_function ----
gtk_tree_view_set_column_drag_function 
Sets a user function for determining where a column may be dropped whendragged.  This function is called on every column pair in turn at thebeginning of a column drag to determine where a drop can take place.  Thearguments passed to func are: the tree_view, the GtkTreeViewColumn beingdragged, the two GtkTreeViewColumn s determining the drop spot, anduser_data.  If either of the GtkTreeViewColumn arguments for the drop spotare NULL, then they indicate an edge.  If func is set to be NULL, thentree_view reverts to the default behavior of allowing all columns to bedropped everywhere.
Syntax
Parameters
tree_view    	A GtkTreeView.
func    	 A function to determine which columns are reorderable, or NULL. [allow-none]
user_data    	 User data to be passed to func, or NULL. [allow-none]
destroy    	 Destroy notifier for user_data, or NULL. [allow-none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_tree_view_scroll_to_point ----
gtk_tree_view_scroll_to_point 
Scrolls the tree view such that the top-left corner of the visiblearea is tree_x, tree_y, where tree_x and tree_y are specifiedin tree coordinates.  The tree_view must be realized beforethis function is called.  If it isn't, you probably want to beusing gtk_tree_view_scroll_to_cell .If either tree_x or tree_y are -1, then that direction isn?t scrolled.
Syntax
Parameters
tree_view    	a GtkTreeView
tree_x    	X coordinate of new top-left pixel of visible area, or -1
tree_y    	Y coordinate of new top-left pixel of visible area, or -1

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_tree_view_scroll_to_cell ----
gtk_tree_view_scroll_to_cell 
Moves the alignments of tree_view to the position specified by column andpath.  If column is NULL, then no horizontal scrolling occurs.  Likewise,if path is NULL no vertical scrolling occurs.  At a minimum, one of columnor path need to be non-NULL.  row_align determines where the row isplaced, and col_align determines where column is placed.  Both are expectedto be between 0.0 and 1.0. 0.0 means left/top alignment, 1.0 meansright/bottom alignment, 0.5 means center.If use_align is FALSE, then the alignment arguments are ignored, and thetree does the minimum amount of work to scroll the cell onto the screen.This means that the cell will be scrolled to the edge closest to its currentposition.  If the cell is currently visible on the screen, nothing is done.This function only works if the model is set, and path is a valid row on themodel.  If the model changes before the tree_view is realized, the centeredpath will be modified to reflect this change.
Syntax
Parameters
tree_view    	A GtkTreeView.
path    	 The path of the row to move to, or NULL. [allow-none]
column    	 The GtkTreeViewColumn to move horizontally to, or NULL. [allow-none]
use_align    	whether to use alignment arguments, or FALSE.
row_align    	The vertical alignment of the row specified by path.
col_align    	The horizontal alignment of the column specified by column.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_tree_view_set_cursor ----
gtk_tree_view_set_cursor 
Sets the current keyboard focus to be at path, and selects it.  This isuseful when you want to focus the user?s attention on a particular row.  Iffocus_column is not NULL, then focus is given to the column specified by it. Additionally, if focus_column is specified, and start_editing is TRUE, then editing should be started in the specified cell.  This function is often followed by gtk_widget_grab_focus (tree_view) in order to give keyboard focus to the widget.  Please note that editing can only happen when the widget is realized.If path is invalid for model, the current cursor (if any) will be unsetand the function will return without failing.
Syntax
Parameters
tree_view    	A GtkTreeView
path    	A GtkTreePath
focus_column    	 A GtkTreeViewColumn, or NULL. [allow-none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_tree_view_set_cursor_on_cell ----
gtk_tree_view_set_cursor_on_cell 
Sets the current keyboard focus to be at path, and selects it.  This isuseful when you want to focus the user?s attention on a particular row.  Iffocus_column is not NULL, then focus is given to the column specified byit. If focus_column and focus_cell are not NULL, and focus_columncontains 2 or more editable or activatable cells, then focus is given tothe cell specified by focus_cell. Additionally, if focus_column isspecified, and start_editing is TRUE, then editing should be started inthe specified cell.  This function is often followed bygtk_widget_grab_focus (tree_view) in order to give keyboard focus to thewidget.  Please note that editing can only happen when the widget isrealized.If path is invalid for model, the current cursor (if any) will be unsetand the function will return without failing.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_tree_view_set_reorderable ----
gtk_tree_view_set_reorderable 
This function is a convenience function to allow you to reordermodels that support the GtkTreeDragSourceIface and theGtkTreeDragDestIface.  Both GtkTreeStore and GtkListStore supportthese.  If reorderable is TRUE, then the user can reorder themodel by dragging and dropping rows. The developer can listen tothese changes by connecting to the model?s ?row-inserted?and ?row-deleted? signals. The reordering is implementedby setting up the tree view as a drag source and destination.Therefore, drag and drop can not be used in a reorderable view for anyother purpose.This function does not give you any degree of control over the order -- anyreordering is allowed.  If more control is needed, you should probablyhandle drag and drop manually.
Syntax
Parameters
tree_view    	A GtkTreeView.
reorderable    	TRUE, if the tree can be reordered.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_tree_view_get_reorderable ----

It is primarily forthings like popup menus. If path is non-NULL, then it will be filledwith the GtkTreePath at that point.  This path should be freed withgtk_tree_path_free .  If column is non-NULL, then it will be filledwith the column at that point.  cell_x and cell_y return the coordinatesrelative to the cell background (i.e. the background_area passed togtk_cell_renderer_render ).  This function is only meaningful iftree_view is realized.  Therefore this function will always return FALSEif tree_view is not realized or does not have a model.For converting widget coordinates (eg. the ones you get fromGtkWidget::query-tooltip), please seegtk_tree_view_convert_widget_to_bin_window_coords .

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_destroy ----
gtk_widget_destroy 
Destroys a widget.When a widget isdestroyed, it will break any references it holds to other objects.If the widget is inside a container, the widget will be removedfrom the container. If the widget is a toplevel (derived fromGtkWindow), it will be removed from the list of toplevels, and thereference GTK+ holds to it will be removed. Removing awidget from its container or the list of toplevels results in thewidget being finalized, unless you?ve added additional referencesto the widget with g_object_ref .In most cases, only toplevel widgets (windows) require explicitdestruction, because when you destroy a toplevel its children willbe destroyed as well.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_in_destruction ----
gtk_widget_in_destruction 
Returns whether the widget is currently being destroyed.This information can sometimes be used to avoid doingunnecessary work.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
Returns
 TRUE if widgetis being destroyed

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_destroyed ----
gtk_widget_destroyed 
This function sets *widget_pointer to NULL if widget_pointer !=NULL.  It?s intended to be used as a callback connected to the?destroy? signal of a widget. You connect gtk_widget_destroyed as a signal handler, and pass the address of your widget variableas user data. Then when the widget is destroyed, the variable willbe set to NULL. Useful for example to avoid multiple copiesof the same dialog.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
widget_pointer    	 address of a variable that contains widget. [inout][transfer none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_unparent ----
gtk_widget_unparent 
This function is only for use in widget implementations.Should be called by implementations of the remove methodon GtkContainer, to dissociate a child from the container.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_show ----
gtk_widget_show 
Flags a widget to be displayed. Any widget that isn?t shown willnot appear on the screen. If you want to show all the widgets in acontainer, it?s easier to call gtk_widget_show_all  on thecontainer, instead of individually showing the widgets.Remember that you have to show the containers containing a widget,in addition to the widget itself, before it will appear onscreen.When a toplevel container is shown, it is immediately realized andmapped; other shown widgets are realized and mapped when theirtoplevel container is realized and mapped.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_show_now ----
gtk_widget_show_now 
Shows a widget. If the widget is an unmapped toplevel widget(i.e. a GtkWindow that has not yet been shown), enter the mainloop and wait for the window to actually be mapped. Be careful;because the main loop is running, anything can happen duringthis function.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_hide ----
gtk_widget_hide 
Reverses the effects of gtk_widget_show , causing the widget to behidden (invisible to the user).
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_show_all ----

This function is only for use in widget implementations. Causesa widget to be mapped if it isn?t already.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_unmap ----
gtk_widget_unmap 
This function is only for use in widget implementations. Causesa widget to be unmapped if it?s currently mapped.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_realize ----
gtk_widget_realize 
Creates the GDK (windowing system) resources associated with awidget.  For example, widget->window will be created when a widgetis realized.  Normally realization happens implicitly; if you showa widget and all its parent containers, then the widget will berealized and mapped automatically.Realizing a widget requires allthe widget?s parent widgets to be realized; callinggtk_widget_realize  realizes the widget?s parents in addition towidget itself. If a widget is not yet inside a toplevel windowwhen you realize it, bad things will happen.This function is primarily used in widget implementations, andisn?t very useful otherwise. Many times when you think you mightneed it, a better approach is to connect to a signal that will becalled after the widget is realized automatically, such as?draw?. Or simply g_signal_connect  to the?realize? signal.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_unrealize ----
gtk_widget_unrealize 
This function is only useful in widget implementations.Causes a widget to be unrealized (frees all GDK resourcesassociated with the widget, such as widget->window).
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_draw ----
gtk_widget_draw 
Draws widget to cr. The top left corner of the widget will bedrawn to the currently set origin point of cr.You should pass a cairo context as cr argument that is in anoriginal state. Otherwise the resulting drawing is undefined. Forexample changing the operator using cairo_set_operator  or theline width using cairo_set_line_width  might have unwanted sideeffects.You may however change the context?s transform matrix - like withcairo_scale , cairo_translate  or cairo_set_matrix  and clipregion with cairo_clip  prior to calling this function. Also, itis fine to modify the context with cairo_save  andcairo_push_group  prior to calling this function.Note that special-purpose widgets may contain special code forrendering to the screen and might appear differently on screenand when rendered using gtk_widget_draw .
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	the widget to draw. It must be drawable (seegtk_widget_is_drawable ) and a size must have been allocated.
cr    	a cairo context to draw to
Since 3.0

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_queue_draw ----
gtk_widget_queue_draw 
Equivalent to calling gtk_widget_queue_draw_area  for theentire area of a widget.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_queue_resize ----
gtk_widget_queue_resize 
This function is only for use in widget implementations.Flags a widget to have its size renegotiated; shouldbe called when a widget for some reason has a new size request.For example, when you change the text in a GtkLabel, GtkLabelqueues a resize to ensure there?s enough space for the new text.Note that you cannot call gtk_widget_queue_resize  on a widgetfrom inside its implementation of the GtkWidgetClass::size_allocate virtual method. Calls to gtk_widget_queue_resize  from insideGtkWidgetClass::size_allocate will be silently ignored.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_queue_resize_no_redraw ----
gtk_widget_queue_resize_no_redraw 
This function works like gtk_widget_queue_resize ,except that the widget is not invalidated.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
Since 2.4

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_get_frame_clock ----
gtk_widget_get_frame_clock 
Obtains the frame clock for a widget. The frame clock is a global?ticker? that can be used to drive animations and repaints.  Themost common reason to get the frame clock is to callgdk_frame_clock_get_frame_time , in order to get a time to use foranimating. For example you might record the start of the animationwith an initial value from gdk_frame_clock_get_frame_time , andthen update the animation by callinggdk_frame_clock_get_frame_time  again during each repaint.gdk_frame_clock_request_phase  will result in a new frame on theclock, but won?t necessarily repaint any widgets. To repaint awidget, you have to use gtk_widget_queue_draw  which invalidatesthe widget (thus scheduling it to receive a draw on the nextframe). gtk_widget_queue_draw  will also end up requesting a frameon the appropriate frame clock.A widget?s frame clock will not change while the widget ismapped. Reparenting a widget (which implies a temporary unmap) canchange the widget?s frame clock.Unrealized widgets do not have a frame clock.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
Returns
 a GdkFrameClock (or NULL if widget is unrealized). [transfer none]
Since 3.8

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_get_scale_factor ----
gtk_widget_get_scale_factor 
Retrieves the internal scale factor that maps from window coordinatesto the actual device pixels. On traditional systems this is 1, onhigh density outputs, it can be a higher value (typically 2).See gdk_window_get_scale_factor .
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
Returns
 the scale factor for widget
Since 3.10

------------ KeyGTK3GtkTickCallback ----
GtkTickCallback 
Callback type for adding a function to update animations. See gtk_widget_add_tick_callback .
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	the widget
frame_clock    	the frame clock for the widget (same as calling gtk_widget_get_frame_clock )
user_data    	user data passed to gtk_widget_add_tick_callback .
Returns
 G_SOURCE_CONTINUE if the tick callback should continue to be called,G_SOURCE_REMOVE if the tick callback should be removed.
Since 3.8

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_add_tick_callback ----
gtk_widget_add_tick_callback 
Queues an animation frame update and adds a callback to be calledbefore each frame. Until the tick callback is removed, it will becalled frequently (usually at the frame rate of the output deviceor as quickly as the application can be repainted, whichever isslower). For this reason, is most suitable for handling graphicsthat change every frame or every few frames. The tick callback doesnot automatically imply a relayout or repaint. If you want arepaint or relayout, and aren?t changing widget properties thatwould trigger that (for example, changing the text of a GtkLabel),then you will have to call gtk_widget_queue_resize  orgtk_widget_queue_draw_area  yourself.gdk_frame_clock_get_frame_time  should generally be used for timingcontinuous animations andgdk_frame_timings_get_predicted_presentation_time  if you aretrying to display isolated frames at particular times.This is a more convenient alternative to connecting directly to the?update? signal of GdkFrameClock, since you don'thave to worry about when a GdkFrameClock is assigned to a widget.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
callback    	function to call for updating animations
user_data    	data to pass to callback
notify    	function to call to free user_datawhen the callback is removed.
Returns
 an id for the connection of this callback. Remove the callbackby passing it to gtk_widget_remove_tick_callback 
Since 3.8

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_remove_tick_callback ----
gtk_widget_remove_tick_callback 
Removes a tick callback previously registered withgtk_widget_add_tick_callback .
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
id    	an id returned by gtk_widget_add_tick_callback 
Since 3.8

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_size_request ----
gtk_widget_size_request 
gtk_widget_size_request has been deprecated since version 3.0 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use gtk_widget_get_preferred_size  instead.This function is typically used when implementing a GtkContainersubclass.  Obtains the preferred size of a widget. The containeruses this information to arrange its child widgets and decide whatsize allocations to give them with gtk_widget_size_allocate .You can also call this function from an application, with somecaveats. Most notably, getting a size request requires the widgetto be associated with a screen, because font information may beneeded. Multihead-aware applications should keep this in mind.Also remember that the size request is not necessarily the sizea widget will actually be allocated.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
requisition    	 a GtkRequisition to be filled in. [out]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_get_child_requisition ----
gtk_widget_get_child_requisition 
gtk_widget_get_child_requisition has been deprecated since version 3.0 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use gtk_widget_get_preferred_size  instead.This function is only for use in widget implementations. Obtainswidget->requisition, unless someone has forced a particulargeometry on the widget (e.g. with gtk_widget_set_size_request ),in which case it returns that geometry instead of the widget'srequisition.This function differs from gtk_widget_size_request  in thatit retrieves the last size request value from widget->requisition,while gtk_widget_size_request  actually calls the "size_request" methodon widget to compute the size request and fill in widget->requisition,and only then returns widget->requisition.Because this function does not call the ?size_request? method, itcan only be used when you know that widget->requisition isup-to-date, that is, gtk_widget_size_request  has been calledsince the last time a resize was queued. In general, only containerimplementations have this information; applications should usegtk_widget_size_request .
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
requisition    	 a GtkRequisition to be filled in. [out]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_size_allocate ----
gtk_widget_size_allocate 
This function is only used by GtkContainer subclasses, to assign a sizeand position to their child widgets.In this function, the allocation may be adjusted. It will be forcedto a 1x1 minimum size, and the adjust_size_allocation virtualmethod on the child will be used to adjust the allocation. Standardadjustments include removing the widget?s margins, and applying thewidget?s ?halign? and ?valign? properties.For baseline support in containers you need to use gtk_widget_size_allocate_with_baseline instead.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
allocation    	position and size to be allocated to widget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_size_allocate_with_baseline ----
gtk_widget_size_allocate_with_baseline 
This function is only used by GtkContainer subclasses, to assign a size,position and (optionally) baseline to their child widgets.In this function, the allocation and baseline may be adjusted. Itwill be forced to a 1x1 minimum size, and theadjust_size_allocation virtual and adjust_baseline_allocationmethods on the child will be used to adjust the allocation andbaseline. Standard adjustments include removing the widget'smargins, and applying the widget?s ?halign? and?valign? properties.If the child widget does not have a valign of GTK_ALIGN_BASELINE thebaseline argument is ignored and -1 is used instead.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
allocation    	position and size to be allocated to widget
baseline    	The baseline of the child, or -1
Since 3.10

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_add_accelerator ----
gtk_widget_add_accelerator 
Installs an accelerator for this widget in accel_group that causesaccel_signal to be emitted if the accelerator is activated.The accel_group needs to be added to the widget?s toplevel viagtk_window_add_accel_group , and the signal must be of type G_SIGNAL_ACTION.Accelerators added through this function are not user changeable duringruntime. If you want to support accelerators that can be changed by theuser, use gtk_accel_map_add_entry  and gtk_widget_set_accel_path  orgtk_menu_item_set_accel_path  instead.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	widget to install an accelerator on
accel_signal    	widget signal to emit on accelerator activation
accel_group    	accel group for this widget, added to its toplevel
accel_key    	GDK keyval of the accelerator
accel_mods    	modifier key combination of the accelerator
accel_flags    	flag accelerators, e.g. GTK_ACCEL_VISIBLE

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_remove_accelerator ----
gtk_widget_remove_accelerator 
Removes an accelerator from widget, previously installed withgtk_widget_add_accelerator .
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	widget to install an accelerator on
accel_group    	accel group for this widget
accel_key    	GDK keyval of the accelerator
accel_mods    	modifier key combination of the accelerator
Returns
 whether an accelerator was installed and could be removed

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_accel_path ----
gtk_widget_set_accel_path 
Given an accelerator group, accel_group, and an accelerator path,accel_path, sets up an accelerator in accel_group so whenever thekey binding that is defined for accel_path is pressed, widgetwill be activated.  This removes any accelerators (for anyaccelerator group) installed by previous calls togtk_widget_set_accel_path . Associating accelerators withpaths allows them to be modified by the user and the modificationsto be saved for future use. (See gtk_accel_map_save .)This function is a low level function that would most likelybe used by a menu creation system like GtkUIManager. If youuse GtkUIManager, setting up accelerator paths will be doneautomatically.Even when you you aren?t using GtkUIManager, if you only want toset up accelerators on menu items gtk_menu_item_set_accel_path provides a somewhat more convenient interface.Note that accel_path string will be stored in a GQuark. Therefore, if youpass a static string, you can save some memory by interning it first withg_intern_static_string .
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
accel_path    	 path used to look up the accelerator. [allow-none]
accel_group    	 a GtkAccelGroup. [allow-none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_list_accel_closures ----
gtk_widget_list_accel_closures 
Lists the closures used by widget for accelerator group connectionswith gtk_accel_group_connect_by_path  or gtk_accel_group_connect .The closures can be used to monitor accelerator changes on widget,by connecting to the GtkAccelGroup::accel-changed signal of theGtkAccelGroup of a closure which can be found out withgtk_accel_group_from_accel_closure .
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	widget to list accelerator closures for
Returns
    a newly allocated GList of closures. [transfer container][element-type GClosure]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_can_activate_accel ----
gtk_widget_can_activate_accel 
Determines whether an accelerator that activates the signalidentified by signal_id can currently be activated.This is done by emitting the ?can-activate-accel?signal on widget; if the signal isn?t overridden by ahandler or in a derived widget, then the default check isthat the widget must be sensitive, and the widget and allits ancestors mapped.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
signal_id    	the ID of a signal installed on widget
Returns
 TRUE if the accelerator can be activated.
Since 2.4

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_event ----
gtk_widget_event 
Rarely-used function. This function is used to emitthe event signals on a widget (those signals should neverbe emitted without using this function to do so).If you want to synthesize an event though, don?t use this function;instead, use gtk_main_do_event  so the event will behave as ifit were in the event queue. Don?t synthesize expose events; instead,use gdk_window_invalidate_rect  to invalidate a region of thewindow.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
event    	a GdkEvent
Returns
 return from the event signal emission (TRUE ifthe event was handled)

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_activate ----

Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget that?s activatable
Returns
 TRUE if the widget was activatable

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_reparent ----

Moves a widget from one GtkContainer to another, handling referencecount issues to avoid destroying the widget.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
new_parent    	a GtkContainer to move the widget into

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_intersect ----
gtk_widget_intersect 
Computes the intersection of a widget?s area and area, storingthe intersection in intersection, and returns TRUE if there wasan intersection.  intersection may be NULL if you?re onlyinterested in whether there was an intersection.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
area    	a rectangle
intersection    	rectangle to store intersection of widgetand area
Returns
 TRUE if there was an intersection

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_is_focus ----
gtk_widget_is_focus 
Determines if the widget is the focus widget within itstoplevel. (This does not mean that the ?has-focus? property isnecessarily set; ?has-focus? will only be set if thetoplevel widget additionally has the global input focus.)
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
Returns
 TRUE if the widget is the focus widget.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_grab_focus ----
gtk_widget_grab_focus 
Causes widget to have the keyboard focus for the GtkWindow it'sinside. widget must be a focusable widget, such as a GtkEntry;something like GtkFrame won?t work.More precisely, it must have the GTK_CAN_FOCUS flag set. Usegtk_widget_set_can_focus  to modify that flag.The widget also needs to be realized and mapped. This is indicated by therelated signals. Grabbing the focus immediately after creating the widgetwill likely fail and cause critical warnings.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_grab_default ----
gtk_widget_grab_default 
Causes widget to become the default widget. widget must be able to bea default widget; typically you would ensure this yourselfby calling gtk_widget_set_can_default  with a TRUE value.The default widget is activated whenthe user presses Enter in a window. Default widgets must beactivatable, that is, gtk_widget_activate  should affect them. Notethat GtkEntry widgets require the ?activates-default? propertyset to TRUE before they activate the default widget when Enteris pressed and the GtkEntry is focused.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_name ----
gtk_widget_set_name 
Widgets can be named, which allows you to refer to them from aCSS file. You can apply a style to widgets with a particular namein the CSS file. See the documentation for the CSS syntax (on thesame page as the docs for GtkStyleContext).Note that the CSS syntax has certain special characters to delimitand represent elements in a selector (period, #, >, *...), so usingthese will make your widget impossible to match by name. Any combinationof alphanumeric symbols, dashes and underscores will suffice.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
name    	name for the widget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_get_name ----
gtk_widget_get_name 
Retrieves the name of a widget. See gtk_widget_set_name  for thesignificance of widget names.

Sets the stateof a widget (insensitive, prelighted, etc.) Usually you should setthe state using wrapper functions such as gtk_widget_set_sensitive .
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
state    	new state for widget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_sensitive ----
gtk_widget_set_sensitive

Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
sensitive    	TRUE to make the widget sensitive

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_parent ----
gtk_widget_set_parent 
This function is useful only when implementing subclasses ofGtkContainer.Sets the container as the parent of widget, and takes care ofsome details such as updating the state and style of the childto reflect its new location. The opposite function isgtk_widget_unparent .
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
parent    	parent container

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_parent_window ----
gtk_widget_set_parent_window 
Sets a non default parent window for widget.For GtkWindow classes, setting a parent_window effects whetherthe window is a toplevel window or can be embedded into otherwidgets.For GtkWindow classes, this needs to be called before thewindow is realized.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_events ----
gtk_widget_set_events 
Sets the event mask (see GdkEventMask) for a widget. The eventmask determines which events a widget will receive. Keep in mindthat different widgets have different default event masks, and bychanging the event mask you may disrupt a widget?s functionality,so be careful. This function must be called while a widget isunrealized. Consider gtk_widget_add_events  for widgets that arealready realized, or if you want to preserve the existing eventmask. This function can?t be used with widgets that have no window.(See gtk_widget_get_has_window ).  To get events on those widgets,place them inside a GtkEventBox and receive events on the eventbox.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_get_toplevel ----
gtk_widget_get_toplevel 
This function returns the topmost widget in the container hierarchywidget is a part of. If widget has no parent widgets, it will bereturned as the topmost widget. No reference will be added to thereturned widget; it should not be unreferenced.Note the difference in behavior vs. gtk_widget_get_ancestor ;gtk_widget_get_ancestor (widget, GTK_TYPE_WINDOW)would returnNULL if widget wasn?t inside a toplevel window, and if thewindow was inside a GtkWindow-derived widget which was in turninside the toplevel GtkWindow. While the second case mayseem unlikely, it actually happens when a GtkPlug is embeddedinside a GtkSocket within the same application.To reliably find the toplevel GtkWindow, usegtk_widget_get_toplevel  and call gtk_widget_is_toplevel on the result.                    12345[/syntax]        [syntax]GtkWidget *toplevel = gtk_widget_get_toplevel (widget);if (gtk_widget_is_toplevel (toplevel))  {    // Perform action on toplevel.  }[/syntax]      
      
Syntax
Parameters

gtk_widget_get_ancestor 
Gets the first ancestor of widget with type widget_type. For example,gtk_widget_get_ancestor (widget, GTK_TYPE_BOX) getsthe first GtkBox that?s an ancestor of widget. No reference will beadded to the returned widget; it should not be unreferenced. See noteabout checking for a toplevel GtkWindow in the docs forgtk_widget_get_toplevel .Note that unlike gtk_widget_is_ancestor , gtk_widget_get_ancestor considers widget to be an ancestor of itself.
Syntax

gtk_widget_set_visual 
Sets the visual that should be used for by widget and its children forcreating GdkWindows. The visual must be on the same GdkScreen asreturned by gtk_widget_get_screen , so handling the?screen-changed? signal is necessary.Setting a new visual will not cause widget to recreate its windows,so you should call this function before widget is realized.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
visual    	visual to be used or NULL to unset a previous one

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_get_pointer ----
gtk_widget_get_pointer 
gtk_widget_get_pointer has been deprecated since version 3.4 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use gdk_window_get_device_position  instead.Obtains the location of the mouse pointer in widget coordinates.Widget coordinates are a bit odd; for historical reasons, they aredefined as widget->window coordinates for widgets that are notGTK_NO_WINDOW widgets, and are relative to widget->allocation.x,widget->allocation.y for widgets that are GTK_NO_WINDOW widgets.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
x    	 return location for the X coordinate, or NULL. [out][allow-none]
y    	 return location for the Y coordinate, or NULL. [out][allow-none]

 FALSE if either widget was not realized, or therewas no common ancestor. In this case, nothing is stored in*dest_xand *dest_y. Otherwise TRUE.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_hide_on_delete ----
gtk_widget_hide_on_delete 
Utility function; intended to be connected to the ?delete-event?signal on a GtkWindow. The function calls gtk_widget_hide  on itsargument, then returns TRUE. If connected to ::delete-event, theresult is that clicking the close button for a window (on thewindow frame, top right corner usually) will hide but not destroythe window. By default, GTK+ destroys windows when ::delete-eventis received.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
Returns
 TRUE

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_style ----
gtk_widget_set_style 
gtk_widget_set_style has been deprecated since version 3.0 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use GtkStyleContext insteadUsed to set the GtkStyle for a widget (widget->style). SinceGTK 3, this function does nothing, the passed in style is ignored.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
style    	 a GtkStyle, or NULL to remove the effectof a previous call to gtk_widget_set_style  and go back tothe default style. [allow-none]

gtk_widget_ensure_style 
gtk_widget_ensure_style has been deprecated since version 3.0 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use GtkStyleContext insteadEnsures that widget has a style (widget->style).Not a very useful function; most of the time, if youwant the style, the widget is realized, and realizedwidgets are guaranteed to have a style already.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_get_style ----
gtk_widget_get_style 
gtk_widget_get_style has been deprecated since version 3.0 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use GtkStyleContext insteadSimply an accessor function that returns widget->style.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_direction ----
gtk_widget_set_direction 
Sets the reading direction on a particular widget. This directioncontrols the primary direction for widgets containing text,and also the direction in which the children of a container arepacked. The ability to set the direction is present in orderso that correct localization into languages with right-to-leftreading directions can be done. Generally, applications willlet the default reading direction present, except for containerswhere the containers are arranged in an order that is explicitlyvisual rather than logical (such as buttons for text justification).If the direction is set to GTK_TEXT_DIR_NONE, then the valueset by gtk_widget_set_default_direction  will be used.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
dir    	the new direction

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_path ----
gtk_widget_path 
gtk_widget_path has been deprecated since version 3.0 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use gtk_widget_get_path  insteadObtains the full path to widget. The path is simply the name of awidget and all its parents in the container hierarchy, separated byperiods. The name of a widget comes fromgtk_widget_get_name . Paths are used to apply styles to a widgetin gtkrc configuration files. Widget names are the type of thewidget by default (e.g. ?GtkButton?) or can be set to anapplication-specific value with gtk_widget_set_name . By settingthe name of a widget, you allow users or theme authors to applystyles to that specific widget in their gtkrcfile. path_reversed_p fills in the path in reverse order,i.e. starting with widget?s name instead of starting with the nameof widget?s outermost ancestor.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

Since 3.0

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_override_color ----
gtk_widget_override_color 
Sets the color to use for a widget.All other style values are left untouched.This function does not act recursively. Setting the color of acontainer does not affect its children. Note that some widgets thatyou may not think of as containers, for instance GtkButtons,are actually containers.This API is mostly meant as a quick way for applications tochange a widget appearance. If you are developing a widgetslibrary and intend this change to be themeable, it is betterdone by setting meaningful CSS classes and regions in yourwidget/container implementation through gtk_style_context_add_class and gtk_style_context_add_region .This way, your widget library can install a GtkCssProviderwith the GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_FALLBACK priority in orderto provide a default styling for those widgets that need so, andthis theming may fully overridden by the user?s theme.Note that for complex widgets this may bring in undesiredresults (such as uniform background color everywhere), inthese cases it is better to fully style such widgets through aGtkCssProvider with the GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATIONpriority.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
state    	the state for which to set the color
color    	 the color to assign, or NULL to undo the effectof previous calls to gtk_widget_override_color . [allow-none]

Sets the cursor color to use in a widget, overriding thecursor-color and secondary-cursor-colorstyle properties. All other style values are left untouched.See also gtk_widget_modify_style .Note that the underlying properties have the GdkColor type,so the alpha value in primary and secondary will be ignored.
Syntax
Parameters

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_modify_style ----
gtk_widget_modify_style 
gtk_widget_modify_style has been deprecated since version 3.0 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use GtkStyleContext with a custom GtkStyleProvider insteadModifies style values on the widget.Modifications made using this technique take precedence overstyle values set via an RC file, however, they will be overriddenif a style is explicitly set on the widget using gtk_widget_set_style .The GtkRcStyle is designed so each field can either beset or unset, so it is possible, using this function, to modify somestyle values and leave the others unchanged.Note that modifications made with this function are not cumulativewith previous calls to gtk_widget_modify_style  or with suchfunctions as gtk_widget_modify_fg . If you wish to retainprevious values, you must first call gtk_widget_get_modifier_style ,make your modifications to the returned style, then callgtk_widget_modify_style  with that style. On the other hand,if you first call gtk_widget_modify_style , subsequent callsto such functions gtk_widget_modify_fg  will have a cumulativeeffect with the initial modifications.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
style    	the GtkRcStyle holding the style modifications

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_get_modifier_style ----
gtk_widget_get_modifier_style 
gtk_widget_get_modifier_style has been deprecated since version 3.0 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use GtkStyleContext with a custom GtkStyleProvider insteadReturns the current modifier style for the widget. (As set bygtk_widget_modify_style .) If no style has previously set, a newGtkRcStyle will be created with all values unset, and set as themodifier style for the widget. If you make changes to this rcstyle, you must call gtk_widget_modify_style , passing in thereturned rc style, to make sure that your changes take effect.Caution: passing the style back to gtk_widget_modify_style  willnormally end up destroying it, because gtk_widget_modify_style  copiesthe passed-in style and sets the copy as the new modifier style,thus dropping any reference to the old modifier style. Add a referenceto the modifier style if you want to keep it alive.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_push_composite_child ----
gtk_widget_push_composite_child 
gtk_widget_push_composite_child has been deprecated since version 3.10 and should not be used in newly-written code.This API never really worked well and was mostly unused, nowwe have a more complete mechanism for composite children, see gtk_widget_class_set_template .Makes all newly-created widgets as composite children untilthe corresponding gtk_widget_pop_composite_child  call.A composite child is a child that?s an implementation detail of thecontainer it?s inside and should not be visible to people using thecontainer. Composite children aren?t treated differently by GTK (butsee gtk_container_foreach  vs. gtk_container_forall ), but e.g. GUIbuilders might want to treat them in a different way.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_queue_draw_area ----
gtk_widget_queue_draw_area 
Convenience function that calls gtk_widget_queue_draw_region  onthe region created from the given coordinates.The region here is specified in widget coordinates.Widget coordinates are a bit odd; for historical reasons, they aredefined as widget->window coordinates for widgets that are notGTK_NO_WINDOW widgets, and are relative to widget->allocation.x,widget->allocation.y for widgets that are GTK_NO_WINDOW widgets.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
x    	x coordinate of upper-left corner of rectangle to redraw
y    	y coordinate of upper-left corner of rectangle to redraw
width    	width of region to draw
height    	height of region to draw

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_queue_draw_region ----
gtk_widget_queue_draw_region 
Invalidates the area of widget defined by region by callinggdk_window_invalidate_region  on the widget?s window and all itschild windows. Once the main loop becomes idle (after the currentbatch of events has been processed, roughly), the window willreceive expose events for the union of all regions that have beeninvalidated.Normally you would only use this function in widgetimplementations. You might also use it to schedule a redraw of aGtkDrawingArea or some portion thereof.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
region    	region to draw
Since 3.0

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_app_paintable ----
gtk_widget_set_app_paintable 
Sets whether the application intends to draw on the widget inan ?draw? handler.This is a hint to the widget and does not affect the behavior ofthe GTK+ core; many widgets ignore this flag entirely. For widgetsthat do pay attention to the flag, such as GtkEventBox and GtkWindow,the effect is to suppress default themed drawing of the widget'sbackground. (Children of the widget will still be drawn.) The applicationis then entirely responsible for drawing the widget background.Note that the background is still drawn when the widget is mapped.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
app_paintable    	TRUE if the application will paint on the widget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_double_buffered ----
gtk_widget_set_double_buffered 
Widgets are double buffered by default; you can use this functionto turn off the buffering. ?Double buffered? simply means thatgdk_window_begin_paint_region  and gdk_window_end_paint  are calledautomatically around expose events sent to thewidget. gdk_window_begin_paint_region  diverts all drawing to a widget'swindow to an offscreen buffer, and gdk_window_end_paint  draws thebuffer to the screen. The result is that users see the windowupdate in one smooth step, and don?t see individual graphicsprimitives being rendered.In very simple terms, double buffered widgets don?t flicker,so you would only use this function to turn off double bufferingif you had special needs and really knew what you were doing.Note: if you turn off double-buffering, you have to handleexpose events, since even the clearing to the background color orpixmap will not happen automatically (as it is done ingdk_window_begin_paint_region ).
Since 3.10 this function only works for widgets with nativewindows.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
double_buffered    	TRUE to double-buffer a widget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_redraw_on_allocate ----
gtk_widget_set_redraw_on_allocate 
Sets whether the entire widget is queued for drawing when its sizeallocation changes. By default, this setting is TRUE andthe entire widget is redrawn on every size change. If your widgetleaves the upper left unchanged when made bigger, turning thissetting off will improve performance.Note that for widgets where gtk_widget_get_has_window  is FALSEsetting this flag to FALSE turns off all allocation on resizing:the widget will not even redraw if its position changes; this is toallow containers that don?t draw anything to avoid excessinvalidations. If you set this flag on a widget with no window thatdoes draw on widget->window, you areresponsible for invalidating both the old and new allocation of thewidget when the widget is moved and responsible for invalidatingregions newly when the widget increases size.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
redraw_on_allocate    	if TRUE, the entire widget will be redrawnwhen it is allocated to a new size. Otherwise, only thenew portion of the widget will be redrawn.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_composite_name ----

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_send_expose ----
gtk_widget_send_expose 
Very rarely-used function. This function is used to emitan expose event on a widget. This function is not normally useddirectly. The only time it is used is when propagating an exposeevent to a child NO_WINDOW widget, and that is normally doneusing gtk_container_propagate_draw .If you want to force an area of a window to be redrawn,use gdk_window_invalidate_rect  or gdk_window_invalidate_region .To cause the redraw to be done immediately, follow that callwith a call to gdk_window_process_updates .

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_style_attach ----
gtk_widget_style_attach 
gtk_widget_style_attach has been deprecated since version 3.0. and should not be used in newly-written code.This step is unnecessary with GtkStyleContext.This function attaches the widget?s GtkStyle to the widget'sGdkWindow. It is a replacement for                    1[/syntax]        [syntax]widget->style = gtk_style_attach (widget->style, widget->window);[/syntax]      
      and should only ever be called in a derived widget?s ?realize?implementation which does not chain up to its parent class'?realize? implementation, because one of the parent classes(finally GtkWidget) would attach the style itself.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
Since 2.20

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_class_set_accessible_type ----

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_class_set_accessible_role ----
gtk_widget_class_set_accessible_role 
Sets the default AtkRole to be set on accessibles created forwidgets of widget_class. Accessibles may decide to not honor thissetting if their role reporting is more refined. Calls to gtk_widget_class_set_accessible_type  will reset this value.In cases where you want more fine-grained control over the role ofaccessibles created for widget_class, you should provide your ownaccessible type and use gtk_widget_class_set_accessible_type instead.If role is ATK_ROLE_INVALID, the default role will not be changedand the accessible?s default role will be used instead.This function should only be called from class init functions of widgets.
Syntax
Parameters

gtk_widget_get_accessible 
Returns the accessible object that describes the widget to anassistive technology.If accessibility support is not available, this AtkObjectinstance may be a no-op. Likewise, if no class-specific AtkObjectimplementation is available for the widget instance in question,it will inherit an AtkObject implementation from the first ancestorclass for which such an implementation is defined.The documentation of theATKlibrary contains more information about accessible objects and their uses.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
Returns
 the AtkObject associated with widget. [transfer none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_child_focus ----
gtk_widget_child_focus 
This function is used by custom widget implementations; if you'rewriting an app, you?d use gtk_widget_grab_focus  to move the focusto a particular widget, and gtk_container_set_focus_chain  tochange the focus tab order. So you may want to investigate thosefunctions instead.gtk_widget_child_focus  is called by containers as the user movesaround the window using keyboard shortcuts. direction indicateswhat kind of motion is taking place (up, down, left, right, tabforward, tab backward). gtk_widget_child_focus  emits the?focus? signal; widgets override the default handlerfor this signal in order to implement appropriate focus behavior.The default ::focus handler for a widget should return TRUE ifmoving in direction left the focus on a focusable location insidethat widget, and FALSE if moving in direction moved the focusoutside the widget. If returning TRUE, widgets normallycall gtk_widget_grab_focus  to place the focus accordingly;if returning FALSE, they don?t modify the current focus location.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
direction    	direction of focus movement
Returns
 TRUE if focus ended up inside widget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_child_notify ----

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_get_size_request ----
gtk_widget_get_size_request 
Gets the size request that was explicitly set for the widget usinggtk_widget_set_size_request . A value of -1 stored in width orheight indicates that that dimension has not been set explicitlyand the natural requisition of the widget will be used intead. Seegtk_widget_set_size_request . To get the size a widget willactually request, call gtk_widget_get_preferred_size  instead ofthis function.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
width    	 return location for width, or NULL. [out][allow-none]
height    	 return location for height, or NULL. [out][allow-none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_child_visible ----
gtk_widget_set_child_visible 
Sets whether widget should be mapped along with its when its parentis mapped and widget has been shown with gtk_widget_show .The child visibility can be set for widget before it is added toa container with gtk_widget_set_parent , to avoid mappingchildren unnecessary before immediately unmapping them. Howeverit will be reset to its default state of TRUE when the widgetis removed from a container.Note that changing the child visibility of a widget does notqueue a resize on the widget. Most of the time, the size ofa widget is computed from all visible children, whether ornot they are mapped. If this is not the case, the containercan queue a resize itself.This function is only useful for container implementations andnever should be called by an application.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
is_visible    	if TRUE, widgetshould be mapped along with its parent.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_size_request ----
gtk_widget_set_size_request 
Sets the minimum size of a widget; that is, the widget?s sizerequest will be at least width by height. You can use this function to force a widget to be larger than it normally would be.In most cases, gtk_window_set_default_size  is a better choice fortoplevel windows than this function; setting the default size willstill allow users to shrink the window. Setting the size requestwill force them to leave the window at least as large as the sizerequest. When dealing with window sizes,gtk_window_set_geometry_hints  can be a useful function as well.Note the inherent danger of setting any fixed size - themes,translations into other languages, different fonts, and user actioncan all change the appropriate size for a given widget. So, it'sbasically impossible to hardcode a size that will always becorrect.The size request of a widget is the smallest size a widget canaccept while still functioning well and drawing itself correctly.However in some strange cases a widget may be allocated less thanits requested size, and in many cases a widget may be allocated morespace than it requested.If the size request in a given direction is -1 (unset), thenthe ?natural? size request of the widget will be used instead.The size request set here does not include any margin from theGtkWidget properties margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, andmargin-bottom, but it does include pretty much all other paddingor border properties set by any subclass of GtkWidget.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
width    	width widgetshould request, or -1 to unset
height    	height widgetshould request, or -1 to unset

Since 2.12

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_keynav_failed ----
gtk_widget_keynav_failed 
This function should be called whenever keyboard navigation withina single widget hits a boundary. The function emits the?keynav-failed? signal on the widget and its returnvalue should be interpreted in a way similar to the return value ofgtk_widget_child_focus :When TRUE is returned, stay in the widget, the failed keyboardnavigation is Ok and/or there is nowhere we can/should move thefocus to.When FALSE is returned, the caller should continue with keyboardnavigation outside the widget, e.g. by callinggtk_widget_child_focus  on the widget?s toplevel.The default ::keynav-failed handler returns TRUE forGTK_DIR_TAB_FORWARD and GTK_DIR_TAB_BACKWARD. For the othervalues of GtkDirectionType it returns FALSE.Whenever the default handler returns TRUE, it also callsgtk_widget_error_bell  to notify the user of the failed keyboardnavigation.A use case for providing an own implementation of ::keynav-failed(either by connecting to it or by overriding it) would be a row ofGtkEntry widgets where the user should be able to navigate theentire row with the cursor keys, as e.g. known from user interfacesthat require entering license keys.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
direction    	direction of focus movement
Returns
 TRUE if stopping keyboard navigation is fine, FALSEif the emitting widget should try to handle the keyboardnavigation attempt in its parent container(s).

Syntax
Parameters
cr    	the cairo context to transform
widget    	the widget the context is currently centered for
window    	the window to transform the context to

Returns
 the width of the widget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_get_allocated_height ----
gtk_widget_get_allocated_height

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_get_allocation ----
gtk_widget_get_allocation 
Retrieves the widget?s allocation.Note, when implementing a GtkContainer: a widget?s allocation willbe its ?adjusted? allocation, that is, the widget?s parentcontainer typically calls gtk_widget_size_allocate  with anallocation, and that allocation is then adjusted (to handle marginand alignment for example) before assignment to the widget.gtk_widget_get_allocation  returns the adjusted allocation thatwas actually assigned to the widget. The adjusted allocation isguaranteed to be completely contained within thegtk_widget_size_allocate  allocation, however. So a GtkContaineris guaranteed that its children stay inside the assigned bounds,but not that they have exactly the bounds the container assigned.There is no way to get the original allocation assigned bygtk_widget_size_allocate , since it isn?t stored; if a containerimplementation needs that information it will have to track it itself.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget
allocation    	 a pointer to a GtkAllocation to copy to. [out]
Since 2.18

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_allocation ----
gtk_widget_set_allocation

gtk_widget_set_hexpand 
Sets whether the widget would like any available extra horizontalspace. When a user resizes a GtkWindow, widgets with expand=TRUEgenerally receive the extra space. For example, a list orscrollable area or document in your window would often be set toexpand.Call this function to set the expand flag if you would like yourwidget to become larger horizontally when the window has extraroom.By default, widgets automatically expand if any of their childrenwant to expand. (To see if a widget will automatically expand givenits current children and state, call gtk_widget_compute_expand . Acontainer can decide how the expandability of children affects theexpansion of the container by overriding the compute_expand virtualmethod on GtkWidget.).Setting hexpand explicitly with this function will override theautomatic expand behavior.This function forces the widget to expand or not to expand,regardless of children.  The override occurs becausegtk_widget_set_hexpand  sets the hexpand-set property (seegtk_widget_set_hexpand_set ) which causes the widget?s hexpandvalue to be used, rather than looking at children and widget state.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	the widget
expand    	whether to expand

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_get_hexpand_set ----
gtk_widget_get_hexpand_set 
Gets whether gtk_widget_set_hexpand  has been used toexplicitly set the expand flag on this widget.If hexpand is set, then it overrides any computedexpand value based on child widgets. If hexpand is notset, then the expand value depends on whether anychildren of the widget would like to expand.There are few reasons to use this function, but it?s herefor completeness and consistency.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	the widget
Returns
 whether hexpand has been explicitly set

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_hexpand_set ----
gtk_widget_set_hexpand_set 
Sets whether the hexpand flag (see gtk_widget_get_hexpand ) willbe used.The hexpand-set property will be set automatically when you callgtk_widget_set_hexpand  to set hexpand, so the most likelyreason to use this function would be to unset an explicit expandflag.If hexpand is set, then it overrides any computedexpand value based on child widgets. If hexpand is notset, then the expand value depends on whether anychildren of the widget would like to expand.There are few reasons to use this function, but it?s herefor completeness and consistency.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	the widget
set    	value for hexpand-set property

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_get_vexpand ----
gtk_widget_get_vexpand 
Gets whether the widget would like any available extra verticalspace.See gtk_widget_get_hexpand  for more detail.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	the widget
Returns
 whether vexpand flag is set

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_vexpand ----
gtk_widget_set_vexpand 
Sets whether the widget would like any available extra verticalspace.See gtk_widget_set_hexpand  for more detail.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	the widget
expand    	whether to expand

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_get_vexpand_set ----
gtk_widget_get_vexpand_set 
Gets whether gtk_widget_set_vexpand  has been used toexplicitly set the expand flag on this widget.See gtk_widget_get_hexpand_set  for more detail.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	the widget
Returns
 whether vexpand has been explicitly set

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_set_vexpand_set ----
gtk_widget_set_vexpand_set 
Sets whether the vexpand flag (see gtk_widget_get_vexpand ) willbe used.See gtk_widget_set_hexpand_set  for more detail.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	the widget
set    	value for vexpand-set property

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_queue_compute_expand ----
gtk_widget_queue_compute_expand 
Mark widget as needing to recompute its expand flags. Callthis function when setting legacy expand child propertieson the child of a container.See gtk_widget_compute_expand .
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	a GtkWidget

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_compute_expand ----
gtk_widget_compute_expand 
Computes whether a container should give this widget extra spacewhen possible. Containers should check this, rather thanlooking at gtk_widget_get_hexpand  or gtk_widget_get_vexpand .This function already checks whether the widget is visible, sovisibility does not need to be checked separately. Non-visiblewidgets are not expanded.The computed expand value uses either the expand setting explicitlyset on the widget itself, or, if none has been explicitly set,the widget may expand if some of its children do.
Syntax
Parameters
widget    	the widget
orientation    	expand direction
Returns
 whether widget tree rooted here should be expanded

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_widget_init_template ----
gtk_widget_init_template 
Creates and initializes child widgets defined in templates. Thisfunction must be called in the instance initializer for anyclass which assigned itself a template using gtk_widget_class_set_template It is important to call this function in the instance initializerof a GtkWidget subclass and not in GObject.constructed  orGObject.constructor  for two reasons.One reason is that generally derived widgets will assume that parentclass composite widgets have been created in their instanceinitializers.Another reason is that when calling g_object_new  on a widget withcomposite templates, it?s important to build the composite widgetsbefore the construct properties are set. Properties passed to g_object_new should take precedence over properties set in the private template XML.

gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_full 
Automatically assign an object declared in the class template XML to be set to a locationon a freshly built instance?s private data, or alternatively accessible via gtk_widget_get_template_child .The struct can point either into the public instance, then you should use G_STRUCT_OFFSET(WidgetType, member)for struct_offset,  or in the private struct, then you should use G_PRIVATE_OFFSET(WidgetType, member).An explicit strong reference will be held automatically for the duration of yourinstance?s life cycle, it will be released automatically when GObjectClass.dispose  runson your instance and if a struct_offset that is != 0 is specified, then the automatic locationin your instance public or private data will be set to NULL. You can however access an automated childpointer the first time your classes GObjectClass.dispose  runs, or alternatively inGtkWidgetClass.destroy .If internal_child is specified, GtkBuildableIface.get_internal_child  will be automaticallyimplemented by the GtkWidget class so there is no need to implement it manually.The wrapper macros gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child , gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_internal ,gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private  and gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_internal_private might be more convenient to use.Note that this must be called from a composite widget classes classinitializer after calling gtk_widget_class_set_template .

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_new ----
gtk_window_new 
Creates a new GtkWindow, which is a toplevel window that cancontain other widgets. Nearly always, the type of the window shouldbe GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL. If you?re implementing something like apopup menu from scratch (which is a bad idea, just use GtkMenu),you might use GTK_WINDOW_POPUP. GTK_WINDOW_POPUP is not fordialogs, though in some other toolkits dialogs are called ?popups?.In GTK+, GTK_WINDOW_POPUP means a pop-up menu or pop-up tooltip.On X11, popup windows are not controlled by thewindow manager.If you simply want an undecorated window (no window borders), usegtk_window_set_decorated , don?t use GTK_WINDOW_POPUP.All top-level windows created by gtk_window_new  are stored inan internal top-level window list.  This list can be obtained fromgtk_window_list_toplevels .  Due to Gtk+ keeping a reference tothe window internally, gtk_window_new  does not return a referenceto the caller.To delete a GtkWindow, call gtk_widget_destroy .
Syntax
Parameters
type    	type of window
Returns
 a new GtkWindow.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_title ----
gtk_window_set_title 
Sets the title of the GtkWindow. The title of a window will bedisplayed in its title bar; on the X Window System, the title baris rendered by the window manager,so exactly how the title appears to users may varyaccording to a user?s exact configuration. The title should help auser distinguish this window from other windows they may haveopen. A good title might include the application name and currentdocument filename, for example.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
title    	title of the window

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_wmclass ----
gtk_window_set_wmclass 
Don?t use this function. It sets the X Window System ?class? and?name? hints for a window.  According to the ICCCM, you shouldalways set these to the same value for all windows in anapplication, and GTK+ sets them to that value by default, so callingthis function is sort of pointless. However, you may want to callgtk_window_set_role  on each window in your application, for thebenefit of the session manager. Setting the role allows the windowmanager to restore window positions when loading a saved session.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
wmclass_name    	window name hint
wmclass_class    	window class hint

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_resizable ----
gtk_window_set_resizable 
Sets whether the user can resize a window. Windows are user resizableby default.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
resizable    	TRUE if the user can resize this window

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_get_resizable ----
gtk_window_get_resizable 
Gets the value set by gtk_window_set_resizable .
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
Returns
 TRUE if the user can resize the window

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_add_accel_group ----
gtk_window_add_accel_group 
Associate accel_group with window, such that callinggtk_accel_groups_activate  on window will activate acceleratorsin accel_group.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	window to attach accelerator group to
accel_group    	a GtkAccelGroup

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_remove_accel_group ----
gtk_window_remove_accel_group 
Reverses the effects of gtk_window_add_accel_group .
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
accel_group    	a GtkAccelGroup

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_activate_focus ----
gtk_window_activate_focus 
Activates the current focused widget within the window.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
Returns
 TRUE if a widget got activated.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_activate_default ----
gtk_window_activate_default 
Activates the default widget for the window, unless the current focused widget has been configured to receive the default action (see gtk_widget_set_receives_default ), in which case thefocused widget is activated.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
Returns
 TRUE if a widget got activated.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_modal ----
gtk_window_set_modal 
Sets a window modal or non-modal. Modal windows prevent interactionwith other windows in the same application. To keep modal dialogson top of main application windows, usegtk_window_set_transient_for  to make the dialog transient for theparent; most window managerswill then disallow lowering the dialog below the parent.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
modal    	whether the window is modal

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_default_size ----
gtk_window_set_default_size 
Sets the default size of a window. If the window?s ?natural? size(its size request) is larger than the default, the default will beignored. More generally, if the default size does not obey thegeometry hints for the window (gtk_window_set_geometry_hints  canbe used to set these explicitly), the default size will be clampedto the nearest permitted size.Unlike gtk_widget_set_size_request , which sets a size request fora widget and thus would keep users from shrinking the window, thisfunction only sets the initial size, just as if the user hadresized the window themselves. Users can still shrink the windowagain as they normally would. Setting a default size of -1 means touse the ?natural? default size (the size request of the window).For more control over a window?s initial size and how resizing works,investigate gtk_window_set_geometry_hints .For some uses, gtk_window_resize  is a more appropriate function.gtk_window_resize  changes the current size of the window, ratherthan the size to be used on initial display. gtk_window_resize  alwaysaffects the window itself, not the geometry widget.The default size of a window only affects the first time a window isshown; if a window is hidden and re-shown, it will remember the sizeit had prior to hiding, rather than using the default size.Windows can?t actually be 0x0 in size, they must be at least 1x1, butpassing 0 for width and height is OK, resulting in a 1x1 default size.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
width    	width in pixels, or -1 to unset the default width
height    	height in pixels, or -1 to unset the default height

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_default_geometry ----
gtk_window_set_default_geometry 
Like gtk_window_set_default_size , but width and height are interpretedin terms of the base size and increment set withgtk_window_set_geometry_hints.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
width    	width in resize increments, or -1 to unset the default width
height    	height in resize increments, or -1 to unset the default height
Since 3.0

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_geometry_hints ----
gtk_window_set_geometry_hints 
This function sets up hints about how a window can be resized bythe user.  You can set a minimum and maximum size; allowed resizeincrements (e.g. for xterm, you can only resize by the size of acharacter); aspect ratios; and more. See the GdkGeometry struct.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
geometry_widget    	 widget the geometry hints will be applied to or NULL. [allow-none]
geometry    	 struct containing geometry information or NULL. [allow-none]
geom_mask    	mask indicating which struct fields should be paid attention to

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_gravity ----
gtk_window_set_gravity 
Window gravity defines the meaning of coordinates passed togtk_window_move . See gtk_window_move  and GdkGravity formore details.The default window gravity is GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST which willtypically ?do what you mean.?
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
gravity    	window gravity

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_get_gravity ----
gtk_window_get_gravity 
Gets the value set by gtk_window_set_gravity .
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
Returns
 window gravity. [transfer none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_position ----
gtk_window_set_position 
Sets a position constraint for this window. If the old or newconstraint is GTK_WIN_POS_CENTER_ALWAYS, this will also causethe window to be repositioned to satisfy the new constraint.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow.
position    	a position constraint.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_transient_for ----
gtk_window_set_transient_for 
Dialog windows should be set transient for the main applicationwindow they were spawned from. This allowswindow managers to e.g. keep thedialog on top of the main window, or center the dialog over themain window. gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons  and other conveniencefunctions in GTK+ will sometimes callgtk_window_set_transient_for  on your behalf.Passing NULL for parent unsets the current transient window.On Windows, this function puts the child window on top of the parent,much as the window manager would have done on X.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
parent    	 parent window, or NULL. [allow-none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_attached_to ----
gtk_window_set_attached_to 
Marks window as attached to attach_widget. This creates a logical bindingbetween the window and the widget it belongs to, which is used by GTK+ topropagate information such as styling or accessibility to window as if itwas a children of attach_widget.Examples of places where specifying this relation is useful are for instancea GtkMenu created by a GtkComboBox, a completion popup windowcreated by GtkEntry or a typeahead search entry created by GtkTreeView.Note that this function should not be confused withgtk_window_set_transient_for , which specifies a window manager relationbetween two toplevels instead.Passing NULL for attach_widget detaches the window.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
attach_widget    	 a GtkWidget, or NULL. [allow-none]
Since 3.4

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_destroy_with_parent ----
gtk_window_set_destroy_with_parent 
If setting is TRUE, then destroying the transient parent of windowwill also destroy window itself. This is useful for dialogs thatshouldn?t persist beyond the lifetime of the main window they'reassociated with, for example.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
setting    	whether to destroy windowwith its transient parent

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_hide_titlebar_when_maximized ----
gtk_window_set_hide_titlebar_when_maximized 
If setting is TRUE, then window will request that it?s titlebarshould be hidden when maximized.This is useful for windows that don?t convey any information otherthan the application name in the titlebar, to put the availablescreen space to better use. If the underlying window system does notsupport the request, the setting will not have any effect.Note that custom titlebars set with gtk_window_set_titlebar  arenot affected by this. The application is in full control of theircontent and visibility anyway.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
setting    	whether to hide the titlebar when windowis maximized
Since 3.4

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_screen ----
gtk_window_set_screen

Since 2.2

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_is_active ----
gtk_window_is_active 
Returns whether the window is part of the current active toplevel.(That is, the toplevel window receiving keystrokes.)The return value is TRUE if the window is active toplevelitself, but also if it is, say, a GtkPlug embedded in the active toplevel.You might use this function if you wanted to draw a widgetdifferently in an active window from a widget in an inactive window.See gtk_window_has_toplevel_focus 
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
Returns
 TRUE if the window part of the current active window.
Since 2.4

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_is_maximized ----
gtk_window_is_maximized 
Retrieves the current maximized state of window.Note that since maximization is ultimately handled by the windowmanager and happens asynchronously to an application request, youshouldn?t assume the return value of this function changingimmediately (or at all), as an effect of callinggtk_window_maximize  or gtk_window_unmaximize .
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
Returns
 whether the window has a maximized state.
Since 3.12

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_has_toplevel_focus ----
gtk_window_has_toplevel_focus 
Returns whether the input focus is within this GtkWindow.For real toplevel windows, this is identical to gtk_window_is_active ,but for embedded windows, like GtkPlug, the results will differ.
Syntax
Parameters

Returns
 TRUE if the input focus is within this GtkWindow
Since 2.4

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_list_toplevels ----
gtk_window_list_toplevels 
Returns a list of all existing toplevel windows. The widgetsin the list are not individually referenced. If you wantto iterate through the list and perform actions involvingcallbacks that might destroy the widgets, you must callg_list_foreach (result, (GFunc)g_object_ref, NULL) first, andthen unref all the widgets afterwards.
Returns
 list of toplevel widgets. [element-type GtkWidget][transfer container]

Propagate a key press or release event to the focus widget andup the focus container chain until a widget handles event.This is normally called by the default ::key_press_event and::key_release_event handlers for toplevel windows,however in some cases it may be useful to call this directly whenoverriding the standard key handling for a toplevel window.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
event    	a GdkEventKey
Returns
 TRUE if a widget in the focus chain handled the event.
Since 2.4

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_get_focus ----
gtk_window_get_focus

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_focus ----
gtk_window_set_focus 
If focus is not the current focus widget, and is focusable, setsit as the focus widget for the window. If focus is NULL, unsetsthe focus widget for this window.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_default ----
gtk_window_set_default 
The default widget is the widget that?s activated when the userpresses Enter in a dialog (for example). This function sets orunsets the default widget for a GtkWindow. When setting (ratherthan unsetting) the default widget it?s generally easier to callgtk_widget_grab_default  on the widget. Before making a widgetthe default widget, you must call gtk_widget_set_can_default  onthe widget you?d like to make the default.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
default_widget    	 widget to be the default, or NULLto unset the default widget for the toplevel. [allow-none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_present ----
gtk_window_present 
Presents a window to the user. This may mean raising the windowin the stacking order, deiconifying it, moving it to the currentdesktop, and/or giving it the keyboard focus, possibly dependenton the user?s platform, window manager, and preferences.If window is hidden, this function calls gtk_widget_show as well.This function should be used when the user tries to open a windowthat?s already open. Say for example the preferences dialog iscurrently open, and the user chooses Preferences from the menua second time; use gtk_window_present  to move the already-open dialogwhere the user can see it.If you are calling this function in response to a user interaction,it is preferable to use gtk_window_present_with_time .
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_present_with_time ----
gtk_window_present_with_time 
Presents a window to the user in response to a user interaction.If you need to present a window without a timestamp, use gtk_window_present . See gtk_window_present  for details.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
timestamp    	the timestamp of the user interaction (typically abutton or key press event) which triggered this call

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_get_position ----
gtk_window_get_position 
This function returns the position you need to pass togtk_window_move  to keep window in its current position.This means that the meaning of the returned value varies withwindow gravity. See gtk_window_move  for more details.If you haven?t changed the window gravity, its gravity will beGDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that gtk_window_get_position gets the position of the top-left corner of the window managerframe for the window. gtk_window_move  sets the position of thissame top-left corner.gtk_window_get_position  is not 100% reliable because the X Window Systemdoes not specify a way to obtain the geometry of thedecorations placed on a window by the window manager.Thus GTK+ is using a ?best guess? that works with mostwindow managers.Moreover, nearly all window managers are historically broken withrespect to their handling of window gravity. So moving a window toits current position as returned by gtk_window_get_position  tendsto result in moving the window slightly. Window managers areslowly getting better over time.If a window has gravity GDK_GRAVITY_STATIC the window managerframe is not relevant, and thus gtk_window_get_position  willalways produce accurate results. However you can?t use staticgravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.If you are saving and restoring your application?s windowpositions, you should know that it?s impossible for applications todo this without getting it somewhat wrong because applications donot have sufficient knowledge of window manager state. The CorrectMechanism is to support the session management protocol (see the?GnomeClient? object in the GNOME libraries for example) and allowthe window manager to save your window sizes and positions.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
root_x    	 return location for X coordinate ofgravity-determined reference point, or NULL. [out][allow-none]
root_y    	 return location for Y coordinate ofgravity-determined reference point, or NULL. [out][allow-none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_get_role ----
gtk_window_get_role 
Returns the role of the window. See gtk_window_set_role  forfurther explanation.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
Returns
 the role of the window if set, or NULL. Thereturned is owned by the widget and must not be modifiedor freed.

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_get_size ----
gtk_window_get_size 
Obtains the current size of window. If window is not onscreen,it returns the size GTK+ will suggest to thewindow managerfor the initial windowsize (but this is not reliably the same as the size the windowmanager will actually select). The size obtained bygtk_window_get_size  is the last size received in aGdkEventConfigure, that is, GTK+ uses its locally-stored size,rather than querying the X server for the size. As a result, if youcall gtk_window_resize  then immediately callgtk_window_get_size , the size won?t have taken effect yet. Afterthe window manager processes the resize request, GTK+ receivesnotification that the size has changed via a configure event, andthe size of the window gets updated.Note 1: Nearly any use of this function creates a race condition,because the size of the window may change between the time that youget the size and the time that you perform some action assumingthat size is the current size. To avoid race conditions, connect to?configure-event? on the window and adjust your size-dependentstate to match the size delivered in the GdkEventConfigure.Note 2: The returned size does not include thesize of the window manager decorations (aka the window frame orborder). Those are not drawn by GTK+ and GTK+ has no reliablemethod of determining their size.Note 3: If you are getting a window size in order to positionthe window onscreen, there may be a better way. The preferredway is to simply set the window?s semantic type withgtk_window_set_type_hint , which allows the window manager toe.g. center dialogs. Also, if you set the transient parent ofdialogs with gtk_window_set_transient_for  window managerswill often center the dialog over its parent window. It'smuch preferred to let the window manager handle thesethings rather than doing it yourself, because all apps willbehave consistently and according to user prefs if the windowmanager handles it. Also, the window manager can take the sizeof the window decorations/border into account, while yourapplication cannot.In any case, if you insist on application-specified windowpositioning, there?s still a better way thandoing it yourself - gtk_window_set_position  will frequentlyhandle the details for you.

Since 2.20

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_move ----
gtk_window_move 
Asks the window manager to movewindow to the given position.  Window managers are free to ignorethis; most window managers ignore requests for initial windowpositions (instead using a user-defined placement algorithm) andhonor requests after the window has already been shown.Note: the position is the position of the gravity-determinedreference point for the window. The gravity determines two things:first, the location of the reference point in root windowcoordinates; and second, which point on the window is positioned atthe reference point.By default the gravity is GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST, so the referencepoint is simply the x, y supplied to gtk_window_move . Thetop-left corner of the window decorations (aka window frame orborder) will be placed at x, y.  Therefore, to position a windowat the top left of the screen, you want to use the default gravity(which is GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST) and move the window to 0,0.To position a window at the bottom right corner of the screen, youwould set GDK_GRAVITY_SOUTH_EAST, which means that the referencepoint is at x + the window width and y + the window height, andthe bottom-right corner of the window border will be placed at thatreference point. So, to place a window in the bottom right corneryou would first set gravity to south east, then write:gtk_window_move (window, gdk_screen_width  - window_width,gdk_screen_height  - window_height) (note that thisexample does not take multi-head scenarios into account).The Extended Window Manager Hints Specificationhas a nice table of gravities in the ?implementation notes? section.The gtk_window_get_position  documentation may also be relevant.

Parses a standard X Window System geometry string - see themanual page for X (type ?man X?) for details on this.gtk_window_parse_geometry  does work on all GTK+ portsincluding Win32 but is primarily intended for an X environment.If either a size or a position can be extracted from thegeometry string, gtk_window_parse_geometry  returns TRUEand calls gtk_window_set_default_size  and/or gtk_window_move to resize/move the window.If gtk_window_parse_geometry  returns TRUE, it will alsoset the GDK_HINT_USER_POS and/or GDK_HINT_USER_SIZE hintsindicating to the window manager that the size/position ofthe window was user-specified. This causes most windowmanagers to honor the geometry.Note that for gtk_window_parse_geometry  to work as expected, it hasto be called when the window has its ?final? size, i.e. after callinggtk_widget_show_all  on the contents and gtk_window_set_geometry_hints on the window.                    1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950[/syntax]        [syntax]#include <gtk/gtk.h>static voidfill_with_content (GtkWidget *vbox){  // fill with content...}intmain (int argc, char *argv[]){  GtkWidget *window, *vbox;  GdkGeometry size_hints = {    100, 50, 0, 0, 100, 50, 10,    10, 0.0, 0.0, GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST  };  gtk_init (&argc, &argv);  window = gtk_window_new (GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL);  vbox = gtk_box_new (GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL,                      FALSE, 0);  gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER (window), vbox);  fill_with_content (vbox);  gtk_widget_show_all (vbox);  gtk_window_set_geometry_hints (GTK_WINDOW (window),                    window,                    &size_hints,                    GDK_HINT_MIN_SIZE |                    GDK_HINT_BASE_SIZE |                    GDK_HINT_RESIZE_INC);  if (argc > 1)    {      gboolean res;      res = gtk_window_parse_geometry (GTK_WINDOW (window),                                       argv[1]);      if (! res)        fprintf (stderr,                 "Failed to parse ?%s?\n",                 argv[1]);    }  gtk_widget_show_all (window);  gtk_main  ;  return 0;}[/syntax]

gtk_window_reshow_with_initial_size 
gtk_window_reshow_with_initial_size has been deprecated since version 3.10 and should not be used in newly-written code.GUI builders can call gtk_widget_hide ,  gtk_widget_unrealize  and then gtk_widget_show  on window  themselves, if they still need this functionality.Hides window, then reshows it, resetting thedefault size and position of the window. Usedby GUI builders only.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_resize ----
gtk_window_resize 
Resizes the window as if the user had done so, obeying geometryconstraints. The default geometry constraint is that windows maynot be smaller than their size request; to override thisconstraint, call gtk_widget_set_size_request  to set the window'srequest to a smaller value.If gtk_window_resize  is called before showing a window for thefirst time, it overrides any default size set withgtk_window_set_default_size .Windows may not be resized smaller than 1 by 1 pixels.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
width    	width in pixels to resize the window to
height    	height in pixels to resize the window to

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_resize_to_geometry ----
gtk_window_resize_to_geometry 
Like gtk_window_resize , but width and height are interpretedin terms of the base size and increment set withgtk_window_set_geometry_hints.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
width    	width in resize increments to resize the window to
height    	height in resize increments to resize the window to
Since 3.0

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_default_icon_list ----
gtk_window_set_default_icon_list 
Sets an icon list to be used as fallback for windows that haven'thad gtk_window_set_icon_list  called on them to set up awindow-specific icon list. This function allows you to set up theicon for all windows in your app at once.See gtk_window_set_icon_list  for more details.
Syntax
Parameters
list    	 a list of GdkPixbuf. [element-type GdkPixbuf][transfer container]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_default_icon ----
gtk_window_set_default_icon

Syntax
Parameters
icon    	the icon
Since 2.4

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_default_icon_from_file ----
gtk_window_set_default_icon_from_file

Syntax
Parameters
filename    	 location of icon file. [type filename]
err    	 location to store error, or NULL. [allow-none]
Returns
 TRUE if setting the icon succeeded.
Since 2.2

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_default_icon_name ----
gtk_window_set_default_icon_name 
Sets an icon to be used as fallback for windows that haven'thad gtk_window_set_icon_list  called on them from a namedthemed icon, see gtk_window_set_icon_name .
Syntax
Parameters
name    	the name of the themed icon
Since 2.6

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_icon ----
gtk_window_set_icon 
Sets up the icon representing a GtkWindow. This icon is used whenthe window is minimized (also known as iconified).  Some windowmanagers or desktop environments may also place it in the windowframe, or display it in other contexts.The icon should be provided in whatever size it was naturallydrawn; that is, don?t scale the image before passing it toGTK+. Scaling is postponed until the last minute, when the desiredfinal size is known, to allow best quality.If you have your icon hand-drawn in multiple sizes, usegtk_window_set_icon_list . Then the best size will be used.This function is equivalent to calling gtk_window_set_icon_list with a 1-element list.See also gtk_window_set_default_icon_list  to set the iconfor all windows in your application in one go.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
icon    	 icon image, or NULL. [allow-none]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_icon_list ----
gtk_window_set_icon_list 
Sets up the icon representing a GtkWindow. The icon is used whenthe window is minimized (also known as iconified).  Some windowmanagers or desktop environments may also place it in the windowframe, or display it in other contexts.gtk_window_set_icon_list  allows you to pass in the same icon inseveral hand-drawn sizes. The list should contain the natural sizesyour icon is available in; that is, don?t scale the image beforepassing it to GTK+. Scaling is postponed until the last minute,when the desired final size is known, to allow best quality.By passing several sizes, you may improve the final image qualityof the icon, by reducing or eliminating automatic image scaling.Recommended sizes to provide: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48 at minimum, andlarger images (64x64, 128x128) if you have them.See also gtk_window_set_default_icon_list  to set the iconfor all windows in your application in one go.Note that transient windows (those who have been set transient for anotherwindow using gtk_window_set_transient_for ) will inherit theiricon from their transient parent. So there?s no need to explicitlyset the icon on transient windows.
Syntax
Parameters
window    	a GtkWindow
list    	 list of GdkPixbuf. [element-type GdkPixbuf]

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_icon_from_file ----

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_auto_startup_notification ----
gtk_window_set_auto_startup_notification 
By default, after showing the first GtkWindow, GTK+ calls gdk_notify_startup_complete .  Call this function to disable the automatic startup notification. You might do this if your first window is a splash screen, and you want to delay notification until after your real main window has been shown, for example.In that example, you would disable startup notificationtemporarily, show your splash screen, then re-enable it so thatshowing the main window would automatically result in notification.
Syntax
Parameters
setting    	TRUE to automatically do startup notification

Returns
 the requested opacity for this window.
Since 2.12

------------ KeyGTK3gtk_window_set_opacity ----
gtk_window_set_opacity 
gtk_window_set_opacity has been deprecated since version 3.8 and should not be used in newly-written code.Use gtk_widget_set_opacity instead.Request the windowing system to make window partially transparent,with opacity 0 being fully transparent and 1 fully opaque. (Valuesof the opacity parameter are clamped to the [0,1] range.) On X11this has any effect only on X screens with a compositing managerrunning. See gtk_widget_is_composited . On Windows it should workalways.Note that setting a window?s opacity after the window has beenshown causes it to flicker once on Windows.
