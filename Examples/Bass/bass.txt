What's the point?
=================
BASS is an audio library for use in software on several platforms. Its purpose
is to provide developers with powerful and efficient sample, stream, MOD music,
and recording functions. All in a compact DLL that won't bloat your software.

See the documentation for descriptions of all the BASS functions. Also check
the included example source-codes for some examples of how to use BASS in your
own programs.


Requirements
============
Win32 version
-------------
Windows 98 or newer is required with an SSE-supporting CPU. BASS can use WASAPI
or DirectSound for playback and recording. WASAPI is the default on Windows
Vista and newer, while DirectSound is on older Windows versions. 32-bit and
64-bit Windows are supported.

macOS version
-------------
macOS 10.5 or above is required. The x86_64 / arm64 / i386 architectures are
supported in a single universal library.

Linux version
-------------
BASS requires ALSA for playback and recording, but decoding and silent playback
on the "No sound" device is still possible without it. The x86 / x86_64 /
armhf / aarch64 architectures are supported. The x86 build requires SSE, while
the armhf build requires ARMv6+VFP2 or above.

Android version
---------------
Android 2.3 or above is required. BASS can use AAudio, OpenSL ES, or AudioTrack
for playback (OpenSL ES is used for recording). AAudio is the default on Android
8.1 and above, while OpenSL ES is on older Android versions. The armeabi-v7a /
arm64-v8a / x86 / x86_64 architectures are supported.

iOS version
-----------
iOS 8 or above is required. armv7 / armv7s / arm64 "device" builds and
i386 / x86_64 / arm64 "simulator" builds are supported in a single universal
framework.


Main Features
=============
* Samples
  supports WAV/AIFF/MP3/MP2/MP1/OGG and custom generated samples

* Sample streams
  stream any sample data in 8/16/32 bit, with both "push" and "pull" systems

* OS codecs
  ACM, Media Foundation and CoreAudio codec support for additional audio formats

* Multi-channel streaming
  support for more than plain stereo, including multi-channel OGG/WAV/AIFF files

* MOD music
  uses the same engine as XMPlay = best accuracy, speed, and quality

* MO3 music
  MP3/OGG compressed MOD music

* Add-on system
  support for more formats is available via add-ons (aka plugins)

* Multiple outputs
  simultaneously use multiple soundcards, and move channels between them

* Recording
  flexible recording system, with support for multiple devices

* Decode without playback
  streams and MOD musics can be outputted in any way you want

* Speaker assignment
  assign streams and MOD musics to specific speakers

* High precision synchronization
  synchronize events in your software to the streams and MOD musics

* Effects
  chorus/compressor/distortion/echo/flanger/gargle/parameq/reverb

* User-defined DSP functions
  custom effects may be applied to individual streams or the final output mix

* 32 bit floating-point decoding and processing
  floating-point stream/music decoding, DSP/FX, and recording

* 3D sound
  play samples/streams/musics in any 3D position


Using BASS
==========
There is no guarantee that all future BASS versions will be compatible
with all previous versions, so your program should use BASS_GetVersion
to check the version that is loaded. This also means that you should
put the BASS module in the same directory as your executable (not just
somewhere in the path), to avoid the possibility of a wrong version being
loaded.

If you are updating your software from a previous BASS version, then
you should check the "History" section (below), to see if any of the
functions that you are using have been affected by a change.

Win32 version
-------------
C/C++, Delphi, and Visual Basic APIs and example projects are provided. To
use BASS with another language you will first have to convert the header
file. Or, as a last resort, you could use LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress.

The downside is that you have to manually import each function that you
use, with the GetProcAddress function. But it has been made a lot simpler
to import BASS this way by the use of the BASSDEF #define. Here's a small
example:

#define BASSDEF(f) (WINAPI *f) // define the functions as pointers
#include "bass.h"
...
HINSTANCE bass=LoadLibrary("BASS.DLL"); // load BASS
BASS_Init=GetProcAddress(bass,"BASS_Init"); // get BASS_Init
BASS_Init(-1,44100,0,hWnd,NULL); // call BASS_Init

To use BASS with Borland C++ Builder, you will first have to create a
Borland C++ Builder import library for it. This is done by using the
IMPLIB tool that comes with Borland C++ Builder. Simply execute this:

	IMPLIB BASSBCB.LIB BASS.DLL

... and then use BASSBCB.LIB in your projects to import BASS.

To use BASS with LCC-Win32, you will first have to create a compatible
import library for it. This is done by using the PEDUMP and BUILDLIB
tools that come with LCC-Win32. Run these 2 commands:

	PEDUMP /EXP BASS.LIB > BASSLCC.EXP
	BUILDLIB BASSLCC.EXP BASSLCC.LIB

... and then use BASSLCC.LIB in your projects to import BASS.

For the BASS functions that return strings (char*), VB users should use
the VBStrFromAnsiPtr function to convert the returned pointer into a VB
string.

macOS version
-------------
LIBBASS.DYLIB is a universal binary with support for the x86_64 / arm64 / i386
architectures. If not all of those architectures are needed, the included
makefile can be used to extract the wanted one(s). Type "make x86_64" or
"make arm64" or "make i386" to extract a particular architecture. "make 64bit"
can be used to extract the x86_64 and arm64 architectures (exclude i386), and
"make intel" to extract the x86_64 and i386 architectures (exclude arm64). Any
BASS add-ons placed in the same directory will also be processed.

Since BASS 2.4.17, the BASS/add-on libraries use the "@rpath" install path,
while "@loader_path was used by older versions. If upgrading from an old
version, you may need to change your copy/embed destination to "Frameworks"
rather than "Executables", unless your "Runtime Search Paths" setting includes
"@executable_path" or "@loader_path". The included makefile ("make rpath") can
be used to update older BASS/add-on versions to use "@rpath".

See the example Xcode project.

Linux version
-------------
The LIBBASS.SO file needs to be in the OS's library search path for it to
be found; simply placing it in the same directory as the executable won't
necessarily work as it does on other platforms. The BASS libraries should
also not be placed in the standard library directories to avoid version
conflicts. To meet those competing requirements, a wrapper script could be
used to set the "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" environment variable before loading the
executable. Another option is to set the "rpath" in the executable to tell
it where to look for libraries, which is what the example makefiles do.

When building for multiple architectures, it is possible to simply try linking
with all LIBBASS.SO versions, and the linker will use the appropriate one and
ignore the others.

Android version
---------------
The BASS library includes support for use in Java and native code. The
BASS.JAVA file mirrors BASS.H as much as possible, but there are some
unavoidable differences, mainly in parameter/return types.

When using ProGuard to obfuscate your Java code, the BASS classes should be
left alone (see PROGUARD-BASS.PRO).

See the example Android Studio project.

iOS version
-----------
The BASS XCFramework should be added to XCode's "Frameworks, Libraries, and
Embedded Content" section. If you're using an old Xcode version without
XCFramework support then you can instead directly use the "device" or "simulator"
framework from within the XCFramework. BASS does not include bitcode, so the
"Enable Bitcode" option should be set to "No".

Licence
=======
BASS is free for non-commercial use. If you are a non-commercial entity
(eg. an individual) and you are not making any money from your product
(through sales/advertising/etc), then you can use BASS in it for free.
If you wish to use BASS in commercial products, then please also see the
next section.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BASS IS PROVIDED
"AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND/OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE AUTHORS SHALL NOT BE HELD
LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE USE OF BASS. YOU USE
BASS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Usage of BASS indicates that you agree to the above conditions.

All trademarks and other registered names contained in the BASS
package are the property of their respective owners.

Commercial licensing
--------------------
BASS is available for use in your commercial products. The licence
types available are as follows:

SHAREWARE: Allows the usage of BASS in an unlimited number of your
shareware ("try before you buy") products, which must sell for no more
than 40 Euros each. Non-shareware products are also permitted, but the
product price limit is 10 Euros in that case. The price limit can be
raised by purchasing duplicate licences, eg. 2 licences doubles it. If
you are an individual (not a corporation) making and selling your own
software, this is the licence for you. 

SINGLE COMMERCIAL: Allows the usage of BASS in one commercial product.

UNLIMITED COMMERCIAL: Allows the usage of BASS in an unlimited number
of your commercial products. This licence is on a per-site basis, eg.
if you are creating products with BASS at 2 sites/locations, then 2
licences are required.

Please note the products must be end-user products, eg. not components
used by other products. 

These licences only cover your own software, not the publishing of
other's software. If you publish other's software, its developers (or
the software itself) will need to be licensed to use BASS.

These licences are on a per-platform basis, with reductions available
when licensing for multiple platforms. In all cases there are no royalties
to pay, and you can use future BASS updates without further cost.

These licences do not allow reselling/sublicensing of BASS. For example,
if a product is a development system, the users of said product are not
licensed to use BASS in their productions; they will need their own
licences.

If the standard licences do not meet your requirements, or if you have
any questions, please get in touch (email: bass@un4seen.com).
