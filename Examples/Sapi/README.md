The Speech Application Programming Interface (SAPI) is an API developed by Microsoft to enable speech recognition and speech synthesis (text-to-speech) capabilities in Windows applications. It provides a set of functions and interfaces that allow developers to integrate speech recognition and synthesis features into their software. SAPI supports various languages and allows developers to create applications that can recognize spoken commands and convert text into spoken language.
